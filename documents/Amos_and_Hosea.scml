      <crt>Description: New York / Mahwah, NJ : Paulist Press, [2023] | Series: Biblical studies from the Catholic Biblical Association ; no. 8 | Includes bibliographical references. | Summary: “Amos and Hosea: The Justice and Mercy of God explores the interface of divine justice and mercy in the books of Amos and Hosea in their prophetic witness to the fall of the northern kingdom of Israel. This new volume in the CBA Biblical Studies series explores the interface of divine justice and mercy within the books of Amos and Hosea. Hayes considers the following questions in the light of these two books: When the future of an entire nation is threatened, what role does mercy play in the enactment of justice? To what extent is divine mercy contingent on the enactment of justice? How do these prophetic books suggest that justice and mercy intertwine in the divine response to seriously flawed human communities?”—Provided by publisher.</crt>

      <pcon>This series, Biblical Studies from the Catholic Biblical Association of America, seeks to bridge the gap between the technical exegetical work of the academic community and the educational and pastoral needs of the ecclesial community. Combining careful exegesis with a theological understanding of the text, the members of the Catholic Biblical Association of America have written these volumes in a style that is accessible to an educated, nonspecialized audience without compromising academic integrity.</pcon>
      <p>These volumes deal with biblical texts and themes that are important and vital for the life and ministry of the Church. While some focus on specific biblical books or particular texts, others are concerned with important theological themes, still others with archaeological and geographical issues, and still others with questions of interpretation. Through this series, the members of the Catholic Biblical Association of America are eager to present the results of their research in a way that is relevant to an interested audience that goes beyond the confines of the academic community.</p>

      <ctfm><page id="px"/><page id="pxi"/>Preface</ctfm>
      <pf>The prophetic Books of Amos and Hosea speak strongly to the sufferings, injustices, and crises of our own day. Their words decry human indifference to the lives of the weak and disadvantaged, the pursuit of prosperity and security apart from God, and the disintegration of a community formed and sustained by the divine hand. Disturbing as the witness of these books is, they also tell us that our own experiences of crisis and disintegration are not singular: the human paths of delusion, arrogance, and indifference are well worn. Many have heard striking resonances with their contemporary cultures in these prophetic texts.</pf>
      <p>Amos and Hosea both pronounce divine judgment on a community unable to recognize how far its social, political, and religious practices depart from and run counter to the knowledge and practice of divine justice and mercy. The purpose of this study is to illuminate some of the ways in which Amos and Hosea convey both the justice of God’s judgment on the Northern Kingdom of Israel and divine compassion toward its people. God condemns the kingdom yet reveals pity for and patience with a people blindly inviting disaster. Such revelations prepare readers for divine affirmation of the potential for a post-disaster community to acknowledge their vital connection with God and flourish under divine care and blessing.</p>
      <p>The interplay of divine justice and mercy throughout Amos and Hosea is presented differently in each book and can easily be overlooked if readers focus on one divine <page id="pxii"/>quality as a major theme without acknowledging the role of its counterpart. This book explores the intricate interfacing of divine justice and mercy in Amos and Hosea as a fuller expression of God’s relationship with a particular community in deadly crisis and—through the written word—with many human communities.</p>

      <ah id="ahintro01">Common Threads, Distinct Shapes</ah>
      <pf>Among the prophetic books of the Old Testament, Amos and Hosea are considered by biblical scholars to have the earliest origins. In form, content, and context these two collections <page id="p2"/>of prophetic speeches share significant elements. Both are set in the last decades of the Northern Kingdom of Israel, prior to its destruction by the Assyrian Empire in 722 BCE. Both warn the people of this kingdom of a massive crisis that will overtake them, and both link their announcements of catastrophe to a breakdown in the Israelites’ bonds with God and with each other. In addition, both Amos and Hosea draw on common forms of traditional language to portray these events and relay their significance.</pf>
      <box>
        <bxh>The Northern Kingdom of Israel</bxh>
        <bxf>According to 2 Kings 12, the Northern Kingdom of Israel was formed when the tribes living north of Judah and Jerusalem broke away from what had been a unified kingdom established by David. David’s son Solomon ruled over all Israel from Jerusalem and built the temple there. After Solomon’s death, however, the northern territories recognized their own king and built a major shrine for worship in Bethel, rivaling the temple in Jerusalem. The city of Samaria eventually became the royal capital of the Northern Kingdom.</bxf>
        <bxl>The southern portion of Solomon’s kingdom then became known as the kingdom of Judah, and the Northern Kingdom took the name “Israel.” Both kingdoms, however, were part of the “people of Israel” to whom Amos and Hosea often refer. Other names given the Northern Kingdom are “Samaria,” “Jacob” (the ancestor associated with the ancient sacred site at Bethel), and “Ephraim” (the son of Jacob’s son Joseph and the ancestor of a numerous and centrally located northern tribe).</bxl>
      </box>
      <p><page id="p3"/>The formulations of the two books are at the same time quite different. Amos focuses on the inevitability of a divine reckoning that will dismantle the Northern Kingdom. The Book of Hosea, in contrast, begins with a threefold narrative of judgment as a pathway to the experience of divine mercy. Divine expressions of pathos for the Israelites’ inability to avert disaster accompany announcements of judgment throughout Hosea.</p>
      <p>The aim of the following discussion is to explore the interface of divine justice and mercy within these two collections of prophetic speeches, an interface that takes on heightened meaning in light of the devastation Amos and Hosea proclaim. When the future of an entire nation is threatened, what role does mercy play in the enactment of justice? To what extent is divine mercy contingent on the enactment of justice? How do these prophetic books suggest that justice and mercy intertwine in the divine response to seriously flawed human communities?</p>
      <p>Amos and Hosea offer an excellent starting point for considering how such questions are raised throughout the Old and New Testaments as well as in our own time. The books are inherently connected by their common setting in time and place. Both are unsparing in their portrayals of Israel’s perversion of sacred traditions. Both speak of a violent end to the Northern Kingdom, and both envision the eventual restoration of peace and well-being under divine care. These common threads are woven together in each book to create distinct shapes.</p>
      <box>
        <bxh>Justice and Mercy: Definitions</bxh>
        <bxf>Contemporary definitions of the qualities of justice and mercy show continuity with corresponding terms in ancient <page id="p4"/>languages. These words take on different levels of meaning in different cultural contexts, however.</bxf>
        <bx>Contemporary categories of justice include “distributive justice,” the equitable distribution of benefits within a society; “retributive justice,” the exacting of penalties on those who do harm to others; and “restorative justice,” the opportunity for offenders to repair the damage they have done. Justice ensures the rights of each member of a community. It presumes a set of accepted communal standards as well as fairness and honesty in upholding them.</bx>
        <bx>These facets of contemporary definitions of justice appear in the prophetic Books of Amos and Hosea, but predominant in these books and in the Old Testament as a whole is the <i>divine</i> dimension of human justice. God is the source of justice, the founder of the creative order who provides for all and rules over the earth justly (Amos 1:3–2:3; 5:8–9; cf. Pss 97:2–6; 99:1–4). The people of Israel, in particular, are called to care for and live justly with each other (Amos 5:24; Hos 12:7). Divine justice entails compassion for the most vulnerable (Amos 2:6–8; Hos 2:21–22) and in this sense comingles with the biblical quality of mercy.</bx>
        <bx>In contemporary contexts <i>mercy</i> implies leniency and kindness beyond expectation or obligation, especially if extended to those who have offended or are in distress. The Hebrew word most often translated “mercy” (<theb>ḥ̣esed</theb>) in the Old Testament is rendered as “loyalty” in the New American Bible Revised Edition (NABRE) translation of Hosea (Hos 2:21; 4:1; 6:4, 6; 10:12; 12:7). In other translations of Hosea <theb>ḥ̣esed</theb> is rendered as “mercy,” “steadfast love,” or “kindness.” This range of meanings implies a committed, engaged relationship that entails compassion and pity. Although the word <theb>ḥ̣esed</theb> does not occur in Amos, words <page id="p5"/>conveying compassion and pity do (Amos 1:11; 5:15; 7:3, 6; cf. Hos 11:8).</bx>
        <bxl>In Amos and Hosea mercy, like justice, is both a divine and a human attribute. God is committed, or loyal, to the people of Israel and merciful, or compassionate, toward them. The people reflect loyalty to their bond with God by showing mercy toward those in need among them.</bxl>
      </box>
      <ah id="ahintro02">The Settings of Amos and Hosea</ah>
      <paft>The first verse, or superscription, of Amos sets the mission of the prophetic speaker thirty to forty years before the final conquest of the Northern Kingdom by the Assyrians. The superscription of Hosea suggests a somewhat longer timeline, overlapping with that of Amos but extending up to the collapse of the kingdom.</paft>
      <box>
        <bxh>Superscriptions in the Prophetic Books</bxh>
        <bxf>The initial verses of many prophetic books are known as “superscriptions” that introduce the prophetic figure with whom the speeches that follow are identified. The superscriptions of Amos and Hosea set these speeches in place and time by naming the kings who reigned when the prophetic speaker was active, orienting audiences to specific historical circumstances. Prophetic superscriptions are thought to have been added in the process of joining together different prophetic collections of speeches and narratives. The Books of Amos and Hosea form part of the twelve minor (shorter) prophetic books known as the “Book of the Twelve.” Each of these twelve books begins with a superscription. Not all include a specific setting: six do and six do not.</bxf>
      </box>
      <p><page id="p6"/>The distinctive prophetic content and language of Amos and Hosea can be seen as related in part to the settings indicated by their superscriptions. The speeches of Amos reflect a period of stability and prosperity for many in Israel by exposing the behavior of the economically advantaged toward the vulnerable and helpless among them. The proclamations of Hosea evoke the violent seizures of royal power and attempted alliances with foreign empires characteristic of a time closer to the end of the Northern Kingdom.</p>
      <box>
        <bxh>The Timelines of Amos and Hosea</bxh>
        <bxf>As indicated in the superscriptions of Amos and Hosea, the timelines of these two prophetic figures begin in the reign of King Jeroboam II in the Northern Kingdom of Israel (ca. 782–753 BCE) and the reign of King Uzziah in the Southern Kingdom of Judah (ca. 767–740 BCE). Hosea 1:1 indicates that Hosea continued prophetic activity during the reigns of three subsequent Judean kings, up to the reign of King Hezekiah (ca. 716–687 BCE).</bxf>
        <bxl>The reign of Jeroboam II is depicted as a period of relative peace and prosperity for the Northern Kingdom in 2 Kings (2 Kgs 14:23–29). In contrast, the reigns of the six northern kings that follow Jeroboam II are presented as unstable and short-lived, and the threat of Assyrian imperial expansion into the kingdom of Israel looms during the reigns of the last four kings (2 Kgs 15:17–31; 17:1–3). Assyrian troops invaded and seized the major part of Israelite territory in 732 BCE and returned in 722 BCE to demolish the royal capital, Samaria. Both invasions entailed the forced deportation of many inhabitants of the Northern Kingdom. For an account of the Assyrian threat to Judah under Kings Ahaz and Hezekiah, see 2 Kings 16 and 18—19.</bxl>
      </box>
      <p><page id="p7"/>The two prophetic books draw attention to different aspects of Israel’s frayed relationship with God. For Amos, the primary indication of this failure is unjust treatment of the poor and weak. The sacrificial rituals and feast days the community observes are offensive because they do not recognize God as overseer of the cosmic order and just judge over all peoples as well as their own protector. Hosea relates communal disintegration and violence to Israel’s attraction to Canaanite gods of agricultural fertility. The people’s appeals to God are insubstantial because they are busily seeking favor elsewhere from foreign deities as well as from foreign empires.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the prophetic speeches of Amos and Hosea frequently intersect, displaying common themes and language. Each book can be seen as spelling out the implications of the other. They convey different aspects of the divine-human relationship in a way that encourages audiences to hold both prophetic witnesses in mind at once.</p>
      <ah id="ahintro03">Oral Performance and the Prophetic Word</ah>
      <paft>In order to understand the shape and texture of Amos and Hosea as prophetic books, it is helpful to keep in mind their grounding in a culture in which sacred and communal traditions were conveyed orally. Recent scholarship on the primary role of oral communication in the ancient world offers new insights into the nature of written texts that have roots in oral modes of composing, hearing, and passing on a literary tradition.</paft>
      <p>Literacy was limited in the ancient societies of the Mediterranean and Near East, even after the recording and composition of writing of literary texts. Writing was largely <page id="p8"/>used for practical purposes such as recording business transactions, sending messages over distances, marking territorial boundaries, and memorializing royal accomplishments. Although major empires like those of Egypt and Mesopotamia supported ranks of trained scribes who kept court records and transcribed literary compositions, most people had minimal literary skills. The handing on of communal traditions was for the most part oral.</p>
      <p>Modern studies of oral traditional literature suggest a cross-cultural picture of oral performance before live audiences. “Performers” (proclaimers) related traditions known to their audiences, drawing on familiar story patterns, themes, phrases, and figures of speech. Each live enactment reflected the relationship between performer and audience. The presence of different audiences in different times and places generated new formulations that were incorporated into the tradition while respecting its essential lines. Expansions and contractions of the tradition as well as variations in sequence were inherent in the process.</p>
      <p>After a period of widespread circulation, an oral composition might be recorded in writing to guide future performances. Written texts that emerged from a long period of oral formation show signs of different stages of shaping, however. Each stage was regarded as part of a coherent whole and attested to the vitality of the tradition over time. Written versions themselves underwent additional variations and additions, following a similar path of transmission.</p>
      <p>The prophetic books of the Old Testament fall within a broad category of “oracular speech,” that is, they are presented as words from God delivered by prophetic figures (<i>oracles</i>). In many oracles, the prophetic voice seems to directly address those gathered round, using second-person verbs and the pronouns <i>you</i> or <i>your</i>. The Old Testament prophetic<page id="p9"/> books generally consist of a series of distinct speeches, interchanges, and reflections that have been joined together, suggesting delivery on different occasions and before different audiences.</p>
      <p>The prophetic speeches in Amos and Hosea are clearly marked as communications from God. The phrases “says the Lord” and “Thus says the Lord” are frequent. The experience of divine revelation is stated broadly in the superscriptions of prophetic books, as at the beginning of the Book of Amos: “The words of Amos…which he received in a vision concerning Israel” (Amos 1:1). The first verse of Hosea states simply, “The word of the Lord that came to Hosea” (Hos 1:1). In these verses the exact relationship between visionary experience and the prophetic word is not spelled out, yet the divine role is made clear.</p>
      <p>The variety of oracles in Amos and Hosea imply that articulating the prophetic experience and interpreting its significance for human audiences required more than a single speech. The speeches display a striking range of literary expression aimed at enabling audiences to see human realities in a new light. Although the process of translating divine revelations into words may begin with a single prophetic visionary, the prophetic tradition would be carried on by others who recognized its import for new audiences and generations. Later performers of the tradition continued to modulate it, whether orally or in writing, as they drew out its implications for those they addressed.</p>
      <p>The present written forms of the Books of Amos and Hosea reflect a long process of development and speak to communities across historical circumstances and eras. Whatever the exact path from prophetic experience to written prophetic book, Amos and Hosea display many features of oral traditional modes of expression. Shared images of God as a devouring lion or of divine punishment as a <page id="p10"/>deadly drought relay the consequences of rupture with the divine order. As a counterpart, images of natural fertility and human well-being evoke God’s renewal of Israel. At the same time, the distinctive ways in which the two books take up common themes and modes of expression attest to the flexibility and creativity of oral traditional literature.</p>
      <p>Modulations of prophetic tradition in response to new audiences over time are also evident in Amos and Hosea. References to Judah in oracles directed toward the Northern Kingdom indicate the extension of prophetic announcements of judgment in one region to wider audiences in new circumstances. Oracles of the people’s return to the land from foreign nations and of overflowing abundance in the land point to a later time, after catastrophe has ravaged the nation. Some instances where the words of Amos and Hosea replicate each other almost exactly may indicate the later yoking of these two prophetic traditions to affirm their complementarity.</p>
      <ah id="ahintro04">The Human Context of Prophetic Language</ah>
      <paft>The prophetic speeches of Amos and Hosea are directed toward audiences with a long tradition of belief in a God who not only created but continuously forms and oversees the cosmic order. This is the God who led the people of Israel from Egypt and continues to protect them. With strong language Amos and Hosea attempt to move the people of the Northern Kingdom to recognize the consequences of distorting the divine order in the way they live and to acknowledge the God who is committed to watching over them.</paft>
      <p>Amos and Hosea convey these beliefs within the cultural understandings, language, and literary traditions of <page id="p11"/>the ancient world, drawing on thematic patterns and modes of expression that may seem remote and strange to present-day readers. The particulars of how God acts through events in these books often differ markedly from our own views of how events unfold. Images and metaphors in the prophetic speeches may seem jarring and hard to fathom. Yet readers today can instinctively relate to the sense of communal disintegration and loss that Amos and Hosea communicate so potently along with their affirmation of God as present, in justice and mercy, to human beings. Even the specifics of the prophetic accusations of Amos and Hosea bear uncanny resemblance to contemporary circumstances.</p>

        <bxh>Human Emotions in Portrayals of God</bxh>
        <bxf>Throughout the Books of Hosea and Amos, God is portrayed as expressing human emotions. In interpreting these portrayals, it is important to consider that in biblical contexts verbs like <i>love</i> and <i>hate</i> do not correspond exactly to modern views of the emotions. These verbs most often do not simply represent personal feelings but rather modes of interaction with others. <i>To love</i> is to show commitment and acknowledge responsibility toward another. <i>To pity</i> means to relent from doing harm or to relieve another from harm. <i>To hate</i> is to break ties and avoid further interaction. <i>To despise</i> is to reject. All these verbs imply a conscious course of action more than an emotional state.</bxf>
        <bx>The metaphors of marriage and parenthood in Hosea, especially, evoke human emotions. In Hosea such feelings are not simply rooted in the individual psyche but are best understood in terms of the social weight of familial and communal ties in a culture that does not always match our own. Furthermore, Hosea 11 makes clear that there are inherent limits to the application of human feelings to God:</bx>
        <senseline>
          <bxslf><page id="p12"/>I will not give vent to my blazing anger,</bxslf>
          <bx1sl>I will not destroy Ephraim again;</bx1sl>
          <bxsl>For I am God and not a man,</bxsl>
          <bx1sll>the Holy One of Israel present among you. (Hos 11:9)</bx1sll>
        </senseline>
      </box>
      <p>An example of biblical metaphor that many modern readers find difficult to identify with is the comparison drawn in Hosea 1—3 between the estrangement of the people of Israel and their God and a troubled human marriage. Here God is compared to a faithful, loving husband and the people of Israel to a restless wife who seeks other lovers.</p>
      <p>A metaphor is an implied comparison that evokes connections between things that are in other ways dissimilar, creating striking and memorable figures of speech. Metaphors often offer tangible parallels to what is less tangible. The value of figurative and metaphorical language in the Scriptures, as distinct from literal language, has long been recognized in the tradition of the Church and was affirmed, for example, by St. Augustine in <i>On Christian Teaching</i> and St. Thomas Aquinas in <i>Summa Theologica</i>.</p>
      <p>The metaphor of marriage in Hosea 1—3 draws a parallel between God’s relationship with Israel and human marriage without equating the two. God is not literally like a human husband, nor is the people or the land of Israel a woman. In Hosea the analogy evokes the longstanding ties between God and a community that is soliciting benefits from other gods, but it does not convey the full realities of a human marriage.</p>
      <p>If not carefully addressed, the inherent limitations of metaphor can render the narratives of Hosea 1—3 disturbing to readers who hear God’s rejection and deprivation of Israel as abusive. Reading the metaphor as a literal comparison,<page id="p13"/> one might observe that the wife (Israel) is given no voice to defend herself or even to explain her behavior. The husband (God) casts her off and withdraws support in order to entice her back when she becomes desperate.</p>
      <p>The marriage metaphor in Hosea reflects a culture in which husbands had ultimate authority over wives. Wives were incorporated into their husbands’ families and most often dependent on their husbands for survival. Husbands were accused of adultery only if they had sexual relations with another married woman, and they were free to consort with prostitutes. The cultural realities reflected in Hosea can evoke modern situations in which women are mistreated and their voices ignored. On a literal level, Hosea 1—3 might be taken as acceptance or even affirmation of social attitudes and practices toward women regarded by modern audiences as wrong.</p>
      <p>Problems posed by the literal reading of Hosea 1—3 can obstruct a figurative reading of these narratives. When trying to interpret the marriage metaphor in Hosea, it may be helpful to focus on the essential dynamic these chapters portray: God’s withdrawal from Israel in response to Israel’s withdrawal from God and an eventual reunion between them. Keeping such a focus need not mean suppressing questions that arise from a literal reading, which are valuable in their own right.</p>
      <p>All biblical texts show marks of their ancient culture. This is the incarnational reality of the word of God (<i>Dei Verbum</i>, note 6). These texts nonetheless speak through partial analogies of realities of the divine-human relationship. Readers of the Bible, whatever their cultural backgrounds and modes of expression, can grow in understanding of these realities while recognizing both the power of metaphor to express them and the limitations of the metaphors themselves.</p>
      <ah id="ahintro05"><page id="p14"/>A Brief Note on Canonical Order</ah>
      <paft>The canonical order of the twelve minor, or shorter, prophets is only roughly chronological. Joel, Obadiah, Jonah, Nahum, Habakkuk, and Malachi lack references to a precise historical setting. Although the superscriptions of Amos and Hosea set the prophetic witness of Amos in a slightly earlier time than that of Hosea, Hosea is placed first among the twelve prophets, followed by the Book of Joel, and then Amos. The ordering of these first three books reflects thematic considerations.</paft>
      <p>It is easy to understand how the Book of Joel may have been grouped with that of Amos. Both books begin with the vision of a death-dealing drought, and both end with a depiction of renewed life in Israel and the image of mountains dripping with wine (Joel 4:18; Amos 9:13). Joel closes with an echo of the opening of Amos: “The Lord roars from Zion, and from Jerusalem raises his voice” (Amos 1:2; Joel 4:16). The general consensus among biblical scholars today, however, is that the prophetic speeches of Joel originated after the Babylonian exile, when the community in Judah and the temple in Jerusalem, or Zion, were of central concern (Joel 2:15–17). Joel’s parallels with Amos demonstrate not a similar historical setting but the persistence of traditional patterns, themes, and language in prophetic speech over time.</p>
      <p>The placement of the Book of Hosea at the head of the twelve minor prophets can also be viewed from a thematic perspective. Hosea offers a continuous interweaving of the themes of divine judgment and divine mercy and serves well as an overture to the “Book of the Twelve.” In this context the last verse of Hosea serves as a guide to the prophetic witness of all the minor prophets:</p>

      <ct>Divine Justice and Mercy in Amos</ct>
      <ahaft id="ahaft0201">About Amos</ahaft>
      <pf>The prophetic speeches of Amos weave together oracles of accusation and judgment against the Northern Kingdom of Israel with proclamations of God as the upholder of universal justice and cosmic order. These prophetic words expose how the nation has failed to recognize the reality of the divine order in their social interactions and their worship. Because they have distorted justice and obscured their view of God, the Israelites are about to experience irreversible devastation, as God moves to dislodge ingrained practices of injustice from their community.</pf>
      <p>A consistent message of divine judgment runs through the book: “The end has come for my people Israel; I will forgive them no longer” (Amos 8:2). Israel must prepare for a devastating crisis: there is no turning it back. The prophetic speeches of Amos, however, awaken audiences to the manifold dimensions of divine justice.</p>
      <p>The following discussion traces these dimensions as they emerge through the book. Oracle by oracle, Amos builds a powerful witness to the nature of God’s relationship with the people of Israel. Different segments of the <page id="p17"/>book convey various facets of this witness, creating a whole that enfolds pronouncements of judgment with aspects of divine mercy.</p>
      <p>The first verse of Amos, or superscription, introduces the prophetic speaker: a sheep breeder from Tekoa, a town in the Southern Kingdom of Judah. He receives words from God “in a vision concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah, king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam,…king of Israel, two years before the earthquake” (Amos 1:1). The oracles of judgment that follow center on the Northern Kingdom of Israel, and the reference to a future earthquake sketches a pattern of prophetic warning followed by catastrophe.</p>
      <ah id="ah0201">Prologue: God’s Cosmic Roar (Amos 1:2)</ah>
      <paft>The prophetic speeches of Amos begin with an image of God’s active sovereignty and its implications for the Northern Kingdom:</paft>
      <senseline>
        <slf>The Lord roars from Zion,</slf>
        <sl1>and raises his voice from Jerusalem;</sl1>
        <sl>The pastures of the shepherds languish,</sl>
        <sl1l>and the summit of Carmel withers. (Amos 1:2)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>God’s voice is heard as the roar of a lion resounding throughout the land from Zion (Jerusalem), the site of the temple. In biblical tradition, the temple is the dwelling place of God’s presence on earth, the “house of God” and a holy place of pilgrimage for all (1 Kgs 8; Ps 84). The Northern Kingdom built its own sanctuaries, but the Lord’s voice rising up from Jerusalem carries the force of divine presence.</p>
      <p><page id="p18"/>The lion is a traditional metaphor and symbol for both divine and royal power in the ancient world.<fnref idref="fn1">1</fnref> The roar of a lion signifies power on the move, seeking to quell challengers and hunt prey. God’s roar has a sweeping impact on the earth itself, which withers and dries up in response. From the forested top of Mount Carmel to the drier margins of the land, where shepherds graze their flocks, all vegetation is blasted. The agricultural prosperity of the Northern Kingdom vanishes instantly in the face of divine movements that are independent of human expectation.</p>
      <p>According to the superscription of the book, the prophet starts out from a Judean town near Jerusalem to forewarn the people of Israel. Amos’s trek northward parallels the reach of the divine voice from the temple in Jerusalem. The prophetic voice fuses with God’s voice and bears the force of the divine roar as it lays out the coming crisis in human language.</p>
      <ah id="ah0202">The Universal Dimension of Divine Justice (Amos 1:3—2:3)</ah>
      <paft>The prophetic speeches of Amos begin with a series of six oracles of judgment on nations that occupy territories adjacent to Israel. These oracles extend the metaphor of the lion’s roar by showing the God of Israel as universal ruler and judge, holding all nations to a common standard of justice and humanity. Announcements of doom upon foreign nations are a common feature in prophetic tradition, but only in Amos do they precede the first oracles of judgment against <page id="p19"/>Israel or Judah. The Book of Amos sets the assertion of God as judge over the earth as a primary theme, and the focus of God’s accusations of foreign peoples is brutality inflicted by one nation against the defeated population of another nation.</paft>
      <p>Each oracle begins with the phrase “For three crimes…and now four—I will not take it back,” implying an escalating sequence of offenses that God has resolved to stop by enacting judgment. The word translated “crime” is derived from a verb that means “to rebel” or “transgress” and signifies a serious violation of human and divine boundaries.</p>
      <p>In the first oracle, the Arameans are accused of “thresh[ing] Gilead with sledges of iron” (Amos 1:3). This metaphor implies the total leveling of a region, not simply invasion and conquest.<fnref idref="fn2">2</fnref> The specification of iron adds gruesome nuances of battle. The Philistines, another neighboring people, “exiled an entire population, handing them over to Edom,” presumably as slaves (Amos 1:6). In ancient warfare, enemy captives were highly prized as laborers and servants for their captors, but the Philistines have taken this practice a step further by selling their prisoners of war to another nation.</p>
      <box>
        <bxh>The Oracles against Foreign Nations</bxh>
        <bxf>The oracles of judgment on the nations in Amos share a common form and display many parallels in language. Each begins with the opening formula: “Thus says the Lord: For three crimes of [name] and now four—I will not take it back.” This pattern, in which a given number is followed by its sequel, is an example of a widespread literary convention <page id="p20"/>known as the numerical saying. Such sayings convey a continuing phenomenon, with the second number indicating an increase (see, e.g., Prov 6:16; Ps 62:12; Job 5:19). In Amos the phrase “for three crimes and now four” refers to serious offenses that God declares must cease. The divine statement “I will not take it back” means that the consequences of these offenses are inevitable.</bxf>
        <bx>Other shared phrases occur in these oracles of judgment. All but one of them include the announcement “I will send fire upon [name of nation], and it will devour its strongholds,” or a close variant. In four of the six oracles, the king and leading figures of the nation in question will either be “cut off” or taken into exile (see Amos 1:5, 8, 15; 2:3).</bx>
        <bxl>The oracles of judgment on Judah and Israel (Amos 2:4–5; 2:6–16) begin with the same numerical saying as do the oracles on the nations, and they include similar formulas of irreversible judgment. In this way the divine condemnations of Israel’s neighbors are yoked to those of the people who claim God as their own, testifying that all nations are subject to the reach of divine justice.</bxl>
      </box>
      <p>The city-state of Tyre is also charged with selling prisoners of war as slaves to the Edomites. In doing so it has erased the memory of its “covenant of brotherhood” with Edom (Amos 1:9). The word “covenant” implies a close, kinship-like bond between parties in which each treats the other with special consideration.<fnref idref="fn3">3</fnref> Tyre’s betrayal is reflected in the next <page id="p21"/>oracle, as Edom “pursued his brother with the sword, suppressing all pity,…his wrath raging without end” (Amos 1:11).<fnref idref="fn4">4</fnref> The Hebrew word represented by “pity” (<theb>raḥămîm</theb>) is often translated as “compassion” (Hos 2:21). It is derived from the Hebrew noun for “womb,” evoking intimate ties, like those between mother and child or between siblings. This oracle condemns not simply unrestrained battle rage but denial of the bonds that join members of a family.</p>
      <p>The last two oracles against the nations spotlight particularly horrific acts. The Ammonites are condemned “because they ripped open pregnant women in Gilead, in order to extend their territory,” exterminating an entire population (Amos 1:13; cf. Hos 14:1).<fnref idref="fn5">5</fnref> Finally, the Moabites “burned to ashes the bones of Edom’s king” (2:1), desecrating his memory by preventing the traditional funeral rituals performed for the dead. A more literal translation reads, “Because he burned the bones of the king of Edom to lime,” indicating the transformation of royal bones to a substance with no trace of human remains.</p>
      <p>These prophetic accusations of states outside the borders of Israel create a universal view of the divine exercise of justice. Israel’s mistreatment of the weak and subservient within its own borders is viewed against the backdrop of enslavement and violence inflicted by other nations on defeated peoples. From this vantage point the denunciations of Israel reveal the impartiality of divine justice, undermining presumptions of guaranteed protection.</p>
      <ah id="ah0203"><page id="p22"/>The Lawful Dimension of Divine Justice: The Oracle on Judah (Amos 2:4–5)</ah>
      <paft>Directly preceding the oracle of judgment on Israel is a two-verse indictment of Judah that replicates the pattern set by the oracles on foreign nations. The accusations in this oracle draw attention to the parameters of divine justice known to the people of both Northern and Southern Kingdoms. The people of Judah have ignored the “instruction” of the Lord and have not kept the Lord’s “statutes,” or specific prescriptions for behavior (Amos 2:4). The Hebrew word translated “instruction” (<theb>tôrâ</theb>) also means “law” as a form of divine teaching, and the mention of “statutes” evokes a legal context.</paft>
      <p>The charges against Judah place the accusations of Israel that follow within the framework of traditional norms of justice associated with divine teaching in both kingdoms. The offenses of Israel are for the most part not denounced as violations of specific statutes, however, but as defiance of the standard of compassionate interaction that undergirds communal law and the practice of justice.</p>
      <box>
        <bxh>Modulations in the Prophetic Tradition</bxh>
        <bxf>The oracle of judgment on Judah offers a good example of modulations in the Amos tradition over time. Although the focus of Amos is misdeeds within the Northern Kingdom of Israel, the Books of Isaiah and Micah reflect similar trends in the Southern Kingdom of Judah. After the Assyrian conquest of the Northern Kingdom, it is assumed that the words of Amos found audiences in Judah. They became part of the prophetic tradition of the people of Judah, both before the <page id="p23"/>fall of Jerusalem and afterward, during the Babylonian exile and the eventual restoration of Judah. The same can be said of the references to Judah in the Book of Hosea.</bxf>
        <bxl>A similar example of modulation in Amos is the address to “those who are complacent in Zion” (Jerusalem) along with those who are “secure on the mount of Samaria” (the royal capital of the Northern Kingdom) in Amos 6:1. Both groups are referred to as “leaders of the first among nations, to whom the people of Israel turn.” Rather than serving solely as an accusation of the leaders of the Northern Kingdom, this oracle has been expanded to include the leading figures of Judah. In this verse the “people of Israel” include those living in Judah, that is, those who also claim descent from Jacob, the ancestor whom God named “Israel” (Gen 32:29).</bxl>
      </box>
      <ah id="ah0204">The Relational Dimension of Divine Justice: The Oracle on Israel (Amos 2:6–16)</ah>
      <paft>The oracle concerning Israel is yoked to those that precede it by its first verse: “Thus says the Lord: For three crimes of Israel and now four—I will not take it back.” This oracle is much longer, however. It elaborates on Israel’s crimes and adds new elements, putting these wrongful acts within the frame of God’s particular relationship with Israel.</paft>
      <p>A cluster of accusations name specific practices that sketch a pattern of communal indifference and disintegration as well as defiance of God. The first charge is that the Israelites “hand over the just for silver, and the poor for a pair of sandals” (Amos 2:6). This accusation reveals the general lines of Israel’s crimes while targeting a specific offense: abuse of the accepted custom of debt servitude. <page id="p24"/>Debt servitude enabled members of the community who had incurred significant debt to repay it by working for their creditors over a set period of time, usually six or seven years (Exod 21:1–2; Deut 15:12–15; 2 Kgs 4:1). The arrangement assured the flow of credit necessary in Israel’s agricultural economy by protecting both creditor and borrower if harvests were meager. It offered debtors an alternative to the permanent loss of land and income.</p>
      <p>The oracle on Israel, however, implies that creditors are selling honest borrowers as bound servants with no expectation of release. Furthermore, they are selling those who owe only small debts, approximating the price of a pair of sandals. Such practices distort the traditional practice of debt slavery and pervert its purpose. Whether or not these maneuvers were prohibited in Israel’s tradition of legal precedent, they are denounced here as a crime.</p>
      <p>The next accusation draws out the implications of the first: “They trample the heads of the destitute into the dust of the earth, and force the lowly out of the way” (Amos 2:7). These parallel charges poetically delineate the communal dynamic of manipulating the weak. Another example follows directly: “Son and father sleep with the same girl, profaning my holy name” (Amos 2:7). The Hebrew word translated “girl” is also used to refer to female servants. In this context the word evokes the scenario of a young woman taken advantage of sexually by men of the household in which she serves. The prophetic voice decries this act as desecrating God’s name, or the way in which the divine presence is recognized and acknowledged. God’s name is “holy” in the sense of being distinct from what is subject to natural degradation.</p>
      <p>The following two accusations connect callous acts with contempt for God by locating them at sacred sites. The first act is the retention by creditors of clothing collected as a pledge <page id="p25"/>for repayment of debt to use for their own comfort in a ritual setting (“beside any altar” [Amos 2:8]). The charge reflects a mandate incorporated in the written laws of Exodus: “If you take your neighbor’s cloak as a pledge, you shall return it to him before sunset; for this is his only covering; it is the cloak for his body. What will he sleep in? If he cries out to me, I will listen; for I am compassionate” (Exod 22:25–26). For creditors to hold on to a debtor’s clothes without regard for his or her deprivation demonstrates a basic lack of compassion and a dismissal of sacred tradition. For worshippers to spread out appropriated clothing like a cushion in a sanctuary implies blatant disregard for the God whom they claim to honor.<fnref idref="fn6">6</fnref></p>
      <p>Echoing this offense is a second: the misuse of fines collected by the enforcers of communal justice as recompense for damages to another person or persons (Exod 21:18—22:14). These leaders of Israel have put to personal use the fines they have collected, buying wine for drinking “in their temples” (literally, “in the temple of their God” [Amos 2:8]), presumably during sacred festivals. This accusation points again to the perversion of an accepted legal norm, and the use of such fines for revels within a sacred space is a direct affront to God.</p>
      <p>The accusations brought against Israel condemn habitual postures toward the vulnerable as well as specific practices, and they include the additional element of behavior that dishonors the divine presence Israel proclaims in worship. They further suggest that the disintegration of communal <page id="p26"/>sensibility has created estrangement from God, as the pointed reference to the “house of <i>their</i> God” suggests. The God they profess is not the God who addresses them through the prophetic voice.</p>
      <p>The rest of the oracle brings out the nature of God’s relationship with the Israelites over time. God is an impartial judge over all but has shown merciful favor to this people, defending them against other nations.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorites before 	them,</slf>
        <sl1>who were as tall as cedars,</sl1>
        <sl1>and as strong as oak trees.</sl1>
        <sl>I destroyed their fruit above</sl>
        <sl1>and their roots beneath.</sl1>
        <sl>It was I who brought you up from the land of 	Egypt,</sl>
        <sl1>and who led you through the desert for forty years,</sl1>
        <sl1l>to occupy the land of the Amorites. (Amos 2:9–10)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>That God speaks in the first person as “I” and addresses the Israelites as “you” heightens the relational dimension of judgment. Images of God uprooting tall trees capture the scope of divine efforts to secure a homeland for the Israelites, a task far beyond their own capacity. In what might seem contradictory to the oracles of judgment on other nations, God clears away the Amorites to make a place for the Israelites to settle. The implication is that awareness of divine generosity and mercy should define Israel’s own communal interactions.</p>
      <p>These verses suggest that divine justice means more than restraint from cruelty toward the weak. It also means advocacy <page id="p27"/>and protection. The human practice of justice entails the community’s awareness of its own dependence on divine assistance and a corresponding commitment to reciprocate by supporting those who need help. To acknowledge the imbalance of advantage within Israel and to care for the disadvantaged is to recognize the relational, reciprocal dimension of divine justice.</p>
      <p>It is not only memory of the origins of Israel that brings the relational element of divine justice to mind. God has raised up prophets and Nazirites in new generations (Amos 2:11).<fnref idref="fn7">7</fnref> Such figures articulate and model what a dedicated relationship with God means in changing times and circumstances. The leading figures and families of Israel have failed to connect their past with their present, yet they have silenced those who might remind them to do so: “You made the nazirites drink wine, and commanded the prophets, ‘Do not prophesy!’” (Amos 2:12; 7:13). This accusation intensifies the case against Israel.</p>
      <p>The conclusion of the oracle of judgment on Israel forgoes the refrain “I will send fire…and it will devour the strongholds” that concludes the oracles on the nations, substituting a more personal, more detailed announcement of judgment. It begins with a declaration from God: “Look, I am groaning beneath you, as a wagon groans when laden with sheaves” (Amos 2:13). Although the expression is enigmatic, God’s groaning under the ground suggests not only divine disturbance but an earthquake (Amos 1:1; 8:8; 9:5). The image of a heavy cart laden with sheaves of wheat adds tones of a dark harvest that is nearing completion, an image that yields to a detailed scene of military defeat.</p>

      <p>Rhetorical, riddle-like questions infer the logical path of divine justice:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Do two journey together</slf>
        <sl1>unless they have agreed?</sl1>
        <sl>Does a lion roar in the forest</sl>
        <sl1>when it has no prey?</sl1>
        <sl>Does a young lion cry out from its den</sl>
        <sl1>unless it has seized something?</sl1>
        <sl>Does a bird swoop down on a trap on the ground</sl>
        <sl1>when there is no lure for it?</sl1>
        <sl>Does a snare spring up from the ground</sl>
        <sl1>without catching anything?</sl1>
        <sl>Does the ram’s horn sound in a city</sl>
        <sl1>without the people becoming frightened?</sl1>
        <sl>Does disaster befall a city</sl>
        <sl1l>unless the Lord has caused it? (Amos 3:3–6)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>These questions draw connections between cause and effect in both human experience and the observable realm <page id="p30"/>of nature. Images of lions roaring and crying out recall the metaphor of God roaring from Jerusalem with catastrophic effect on the earth (Amos 1:2) and imply a parallel between the divine and natural dynamic. The last question does not specify a cause for human disaster but indicates that divine agency underlies it.</pcon>
      <p>The image of the lion is then reiterated, bringing prophetic warning into focus as well as affirming divine causality:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>The lion has roared,</slf>
        <sl1>who would not fear?</sl1>
        <sl>The Lord God has spoken,</sl>
        <sl1l>who would not prophesy? (Amos 3:8)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>Acknowledgment of divine power and the force of the divine word propel the prophet to expose pervasive wrongdoing in the Northern Kingdom of Samaria:</pcon>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Proclaim this in the strongholds of Assyria,</slf>
        <sl1>in the strongholds of the land of Egypt:</sl1>
        <sl>“Gather on the mount of Samaria,</sl>
        <sl1>and see the great disorders within it,</sl1>
        <sl1>the oppressions within its midst.”</sl1>
        <sl>They do not know how to do what is right—</sl>
        <sl1>oracle of the Lord….</sl1>
        <sl>Therefore thus says the Lord God:</sl>
        <sl>An enemy shall surround the land,</sl>
        <sl1>tear down your fortresses,</sl1>
        <sl1l>and pillage your strongholds. (Amos 3:9–11)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>A logical pattern is evident in the matching of deeds with consequences in these verses (poetic justice). The prophetic voice summons Assyria and Egypt, symbols of aggressive imperial power, to observe what is taking place <page id="p31"/>within the Northern Kingdom. This is a nation that has lost its sense of what is right, generating disorder and cruelty and safeguarding what the strong have wrested from the weak. As a result, the kingdom will suffer at the hands of a stronger adversary, who will plunder what the Israelites have extorted from each other.</p>
      <p>The questions in Amos 3:1–6 set out the logic of act and consequence without claiming that it is fully discernible to human beings. Amos 3 suggests, however, that the logical dimension of divine justice can be glimpsed in human and nonhuman patterns observable by all.</p>
      <ah id="ah0206">The Communicative Dimension of Divine Justice (Amos 4:1–11)</ah>
      <paft>The prophetic speeches in Amos 4:1–11 portray an oblivious people whom God has attempted to alert through periodic crises. Successive disasters are represented as a form of divine communication, intended to bring the community to join themselves again to their God.</paft>
      <p>The chapter opens with two speeches that characterize the self-obsession of the privileged in the Northern Kingdom. The first speech begins:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Hear this word, you cows of Bashan,</slf>
        <sl1>who live on the mount of Samaria:</sl1>
        <sl>Who oppress the destitute</sl>
        <sl1>and abuse the needy;</sl1>
        <sl>Who say to your husbands,</sl>
        <sl1l>“Bring us a drink!” (Amos 4:1)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The epithet “cows of Bashan” represents women who sit on their privilege in Israel’s capital city, Samaria, calling <page id="p32"/>out for refreshment while making life harder for those with real needs. Bashan, a well-watered plateau across the Jordan River to the north, is a traditional biblical symbol of rich fertility, lush enough to support the raising of cattle (Deut 32:14). Most of the land in Israel was hillier and drier. The metaphor suggests self-indulgent consumption by the wealthier strata in Israel at the expense of the less fortunate, whose difficulties do not concern them.</p>
      <p>The sarcasm of the second speech conveys how indifference to the needs of others taints the offering of sacrifices and tithes to God.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Come to Bethel and sin,</slf>
        <sl1>to Gilgal and sin all the more!<fnref idref="fn10">10</fnref></sl1>
        <sl>Each morning bring your sacrifices,</sl>
        <sl1>every third day your tithes;</sl1>
        <sl>Burn leavened bread as a thanksgiving sacrifice,</sl>
        <sl1>proclaim publicly your voluntary offerings,</sl1>
        <sl>For so you love to do, Israelites—</sl>
        <sl1l>oracle of the Lord God. (Amos 4:4–5)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>Israelites offer sacrifices to God from their abundance but perceive no inconsistency with the abuses that have enhanced their advantages. The Hebrew verb translated “sin” here is related to the noun translated “crime” in the oracles of judgment in Amos 1—2 and carries the same nuance of violating known boundaries. This kind of serious offense turns the giving of sacrifices, tithes, and offerings into a mockery. Furthermore, worshippers proclaim in public their generosity, suggesting that their worship is largely self-serving: “For so you love to do, Israelites!”</p>
      <p><page id="p33"/>The following catalogue of communal crises reveals the extent of the Israelites’ oblivion (4:6–11). They have experienced successive waves of famine, drought, crop disease and infestation, epidemic, war, and unspecified destruction on a massive scale. This series of catastrophic events reflects a larger body of traditional curses found throughout the ancient world. Such curses implored divine powers to bring harm to individuals, families, and nations if they betrayed trust, infringed boundaries, or wronged others. Like the disasters named in Amos 4:6–11, they served as proactive warnings. Because God summons the disasters, they also serve as signs of divine dominion over the creative order and human vulnerability within it.</p>
      <p>The first crisis in the series sets the pattern:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Though I made your teeth</slf>
        <sl1>clean of food in all your cities,</sl1>
        <sl1>and made bread scarce in all your dwellings,</sl1>
        <sl>Yet you did not return to me—</sl>
        <sl1l>oracle of the Lord. (Amos 4:6)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>In this scenario and repeatedly in what follows, the communicative aspect of justice plays out. Each crisis is intended to warn the unresponsive in Israel to reorient themselves to the reality of God and the parameters of the divine order.</pcon>
      <p>The last two crises draw a horizon of total extinction. Parallels with Egypt and Sodom and Gomorrah connect Israel’s heedlessness with traditional symbols of defiant wrongdoing and deafness to divine warning (Amos 4:10–11). In the case of Egypt, the parallel includes prolonged resistance in the face of successive plagues, and the failure <page id="p34"/>of every plague to bring the Egyptian Pharaoh to recognize the sovereignty of God over heaven and earth.</p>
      <ah id="ah0207">The Cosmic Dimension of Divine Justice (Amos 4:12—5:17)</ah>
      <paft>Israel has failed to hear the divine warnings in crises that have gripped the nation. Israel’s leaders have not responded by turning toward God. Accordingly, God will draw near to them, revealing the fullness of the divine presence.</paft>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Therefore thus I will do to you, Israel:</slf>
        <sl1>And since I will deal thus with you,</sl1>
        <sl1>prepare to meet your God, O Israel!</sl1>
        <sl>The one who forms mountains and creates 	winds,</sl>
        <sl1>and declares to mortals their thoughts;</sl1>
        <sl>Who makes dawn into darkness</sl>
        <sl1>and strides upon the heights of the earth,</sl1>
        <sl1l>the Lord, the God of hosts, is his name! (Amos 4:12–13)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The cosmic domain that opens in these verses is foreshadowed in the shriveling of the land in response to God’s voice (Amos 1:2), in the questions pointing to a pattern of cause and effect in natural and human domains (Amos 3:3–8), and in the range of environmental and human disasters attributed to God (Amos 4:6–11). All these lead to revelation of the scope of divine activity in the cosmos, where God is shown moving and forming continuously. God is at work in large movements, creating winds and shaping mountains, orchestrating the passage of day into night, and striding <page id="p35"/>over the highest places of the earth. God is also attuned to the reckonings of human beings, better than they are themselves. This is the one Israel names “the Lord, the God of hosts,” who summons the vast array of heavenly bodies and forces to enact the divine design and is everywhere present.<fnref idref="fn11">11</fnref></p>
      <p>The language of Amos 4:13 echoes the praise of God’s ongoing creative work in the psalms.<fnref idref="fn12">12</fnref> Depictions of a dynamic creative order are not necessarily assuring for those who have exempted themselves from divine justice, however. God’s cosmic activity includes scrutiny of human thoughts, and God moves over the heights of the earth, seeing all below. The characterization of God as “the one who forms mountains and creates winds,” evokes powers beyond human control, and the parallel epithet, the one “who makes dawn into darkness,” carries an ominous tone.</p>
      <p>The connection between cosmic and human order in this proclamation becomes clearer in a second hymnic proclamation in Amos 5:8–9, which is carefully bracketed within oracles of judgment and appeals for justice. Amos 5 begins with a dirge, or funeral lament that foresees the death of the Northern Kingdom:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>She is fallen, to rise no more,</slf>
        <sl1>virgin Israel;</sl1>
        <sl>She lies abandoned on her land,</sl>
        <sl1l>with no none to raise her up. (Amos 5:2)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon><page id="p36"/>A forewarning of military decimation is then followed by a plea from the divine voice.</pcon>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Seek me, that you may live,</slf>
        <sl1>but do not seek Bethel;</sl1>
        <sl>Do not come to Gilgal,</sl>
        <sl1>and do not cross over to Beer-sheba.</sl1>
        <sl>For Gilgal shall be led into exile</sl>
        <sl1>and Bethel shall be no more.</sl1>
        <sl>Seek the Lord, that you may live,</sl>
        <sl1>lest he flare up against the house of Joseph like a fire</sl1>
        <sl1>that shall consume the house of Israel, with no one to quench it....</sl1>
        <sl>Woe to those who turn justice into wormwood</sl>
        <sl1l>and cast righteousness to the ground. (Amos 5:4–7)<fnref idref="fn13">13</fnref></sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>Because the opening dirge reiterates the destruction of the Northern Kingdom, this appeal to “seek the Lord” seems designed in part to explain why catastrophe is imminent. The Israelites have failed to seek the divine presence, despite their pilgrimages to Bethel and Gilgal (cf. Hos 4:15).<fnref idref="fn14">14</fnref> Those who have made justice bitter and discarded righteousness as something to be trampled on have bypassed God as the ultimate judge of what is to be upheld and what condemned.</pcon>
      <p>A parallel appeal occurs a few verses later.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf><page id="p37"/>Seek good and not evil,</slf>
        <sl1>that you may live;</sl1>
        <sl>Then truly the Lord, the God of hosts,</sl>
        <sl1>will be with you as you claim.</sl1>
        <sl>Hate evil and love good,</sl>
        <sl1>and let justice prevail at the gate;</sl1>
        <sl>Then it may be that the Lord, the God of hosts,</sl>
        <sl1l>will have pity on the remnant of Joseph. (Amos 5:14–15)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>These two divine instructions emphasize the choice of what is good and just as key to a favorable relationship with God. “Good” is associated here with enactment of justice “at the gate,” the public square in front of a city’s main entrance where grievances were heard and disputes resolved. If some within Israel can consistently decide for the good of all and ensure justice, then some, “the remnant of Joseph,” can hope for pity, or favor, from God.<fnref idref="fn15">15</fnref></p>
      <p>The exhortations to seek God and the good do not mean that the kingdom of Israel can deter invasion and conquest. These prophetic appeals point to a path not taken. At the same time they chart a way forward for survivors of Israel’s fall. The phrase “the remnant of Joseph” suggests an experience of devastation that only a few will survive, like the obliteration of Bethel and exile of Gilgal foretold in the first divine appeal.</p>
      <p>In between these two pleas to Israel to seek the Lord and abandon wrongdoing, the second affirmation of God’s cosmic movements breaks in to remind audiences of who their God is (Amos 5:8–9). God is</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf><page id="p38"/>The one who made the Pleiades and Orion,</slf>
        <sl1>who turns darkness into dawn,</sl1>
        <sl1>and darkens day into night;</sl1>
        <sl>Who summons the waters of the sea,</sl>
        <sl1>and pours them out on the surface of the earth;</sl1>
        <sl>Who makes destruction fall suddenly upon the 	stronghold</sl>
        <sl1>and brings ruin upon the fortress,</sl1>
        <sll>the Lord is his name. (Amos 5:8–9)</sll>
      </senseline>
      <p>Attention shifts here from the human to the divine realm, from the immediate present to the enduring reality. The contrast between the two is telling. As opposed to those who “cast righteousness to the ground,” the Lord has set constellations in the night sky, providing points of light to guide humans on earth. As opposed to those who habitually “turn justice into wormwood,” the Lord continually “turns darkness into dawn, and darkens day into night,” ensuring the regular alternation of dark and light, essential to life on earth (cf. Ps 104:19–23).</p>
      <p>The imagery of the next poetic line is ambiguous. That God gathers the waters of the sea and pours them out over the earth could refer to the natural cycle of rainfall, crucial to human life, but also evokes traditions of a massive flood that blots out all living creatures. The final divine activity draws attention to destruction in the human realm. God is the one who topples human fortresses, as in the oracles of judgment on the nations (Amos 1:3—2:3) as well as on Israel (Amos 3:10–11). Symbols of human security, such strongholds are defenseless against divine strategies.</p>
      <p>The hymnic acclamations of God in Amos 4:13 and 5:8–9 show God continually engaged in the dynamic order of the cosmos. They illuminate the divine invitations to “Seek me, that you may live” (Amos 5:4) and to “Seek good <page id="p39"/>and not evil, that you may live” (Amos 5:14). Those who seek the Lord and the Lord’s justice align themselves with the cosmic divine order and the divine force that infuses all God does in the heavens and on earth.</p>
      <p>The command “Prepare to meet your God, O Israel” in Amos 4:12, then, leads to revelations of divine activity that might draw the Israelites to recognize the cosmic oversight of God, which both sustains them and overwhelms them. In the immediate moment, however, the Lord declares that “in every vineyard there shall be lamentation, when I pass through your midst” (Amos 5:17).</p>
      <ah id="ah0208">The Dimension of Fear in Divine Justice (Amos 5:18–24; 6:1–14; 8:7–12)</ah>
      <paft>“Fear of the Lord” is a recurrent phrase in the Old Testament. In a broad sense it conveys the awareness of human vulnerability and limitation in relation to the surpassing power of God. God’s movements can override human expectations, creating fear.</paft>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Woe to those who yearn</slf>
        <sl1>for the day of the Lord!</sl1>
        <sl>What will the day of the Lord mean for you?</sl>
        <sl1>It will be darkness, not light!</sl1>
        <sl>As if someone fled from a lion</sl>
        <sl1>and a bear met him;</sl1>
        <sl>Or as if on entering the house</sl>
        <sl1>he rested his hand against the wall,</sl1>
        <sl1>and a snake bit it.</sl1>
        <sl>Truly, the day of the Lord will be darkness, not 	light,</sl>
        <sl1l>gloom without any brightness! (Amos 5:18–20)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p><page id="p40"/>The opening cry of “Woe” sets the tone of gloom, and the images that follow elicit the terrors of flight and of reaching a place of safety only to be attacked there. The verses illustrate the unnerving reversal of hopes for the “day of the Lord.” This day was traditionally regarded as an occasion on which the divine presence would bring victory to the Israelites in battle or deliver them from adverse circumstances. In Amos the divine role shifts from advocate to pursuer.</p>
      <p>God’s rejection of Israel’s sacrificial offerings and hymns is also unsettling.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>I hate, I despise your feasts,</slf>
        <sl1>I take no pleasure in your solemnities.</sl1>
        <sl>Even though you bring me your burnt offerings 	and grain offerings</sl>
        <sl1>I will not accept them;</sl1>
        <sl>Your stall-fed communion offerings,</sl>
        <sl1>I will not look upon them.</sl1>
        <sl>Take away from me your noisy songs;</sl>
        <sl1>the melodies of your harps,</sl1>
        <sl1>I will not listen to them.</sl1>
        <sl>Rather, let justice surge like waters,</sl>
        <sl1l>and righteousness like an unfailing stream. (Amos 5:21–24)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>To the divine eye the lavish tributes offered to God by those with abundant means only highlight their indifference to the lives of others and their self-serving rituals. Images of justice and righteousness (<theb>mišpāṭ</theb> and <theb>ṣědāqâ</theb>) rising like waves and flowing like streams offer an alternative vista of abundance that stands in stark contrast.</p>
      <box>
        <bxh><page id="p41"/>Justice and Righteousness</bxh>
        <bxf>The Hebrew words for “justice” and “righteousness” (Amos 5:24) form a recurrent pair in prophetic speech and elsewhere in the Old Testament. The Hebrew noun translated “justice” in Amos 5:24 (<theb>mis̆pāṭ</theb>) stems from an active verb meaning “to judge, govern, or rule.” Justice is not only connected with the practice of judging in actual cases: hearing accusations, mediating disputes, and determining truth and falsehood, right and wrong. It also implies governance in the sense of maintaining communal order and stability.</bxf>
        <bx>The noun <theb>mis̆pāṭ</theb> is sometimes translated as “judgment,” “ordinance,” or even “custom,” implying communal precedent. As a concept, however, it conveys the social norms of fairness and uprightness upheld in particular judgments to protect all members of the community, norms regarded as established by God. Psalm 99 articulates the divine source of justice: “O mighty king, lover of justice, you have established fairnes;, you have created just rule in Jacob (Ps 99:4).</bx>
        <bxl>“Justice” (<theb>mis̆pāṭ</theb>) overlaps with the abstract noun “righteousness” or “right” (<theb>ṣĕdāqâ</theb> or <theb>ṣedeq</theb>). Both justice and righteousness presume set standards of social interaction and both signify the integrity of interactions that adhere to these standards. The NABRE often represents the connection between these two words by translating the Hebrew words for “righteousness” or “right” as “justice” and the Hebrew word for “justice” as “judgment.” Furthermore, the adjective “righteous” (<theb>ṣaddîq</theb>) can appear in English as “just.”</bxl>
      </box>
      <p>It is notable that this divine call for justice and righteousness follows scenarios of human fear and expressions <page id="p42"/>of divine rejection (Amos 5:18–23). The sequence suggests that the Israelites will respond positively to the divine call for justice only after they grow in awareness of their human vulnerability and their failures to grasp how God wishes to be acknowledged.</p>
      <p>A relationship between inflated human confidence and social inequity is portrayed in Amos 6.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Woe to those who are complacent in Zion,</slf>
        <sl1>Secure on the mount of Samaria,</sl1>
        <sl>Leaders of the first among nations,</sl>
        <sl1>to whom the people of Israel turn.…</sl1>
        <sl>You who would put off the day of disaster,</sl>
        <sl1>yet hasten the time of violence!</sl1>
        <sl>Those who lie on beds of ivory,</sl>
        <sl1>and lounge upon their couches;</sl1>
        <sl>Eating lambs taken from the flock,</sl>
        <sl1>and calves from the stall;</sl1>
        <sl>Who improvise to the music of the harp,</sl>
        <sl1>composing on musical instruments like David,</sl1>
        <sl>Who drink wine from bowls,</sl>
        <sl1>and anoint themselves with the best oils,</sl1>
        <sl1l>but are not made ill by the collapse of Joseph. (Amos 6:1, 3–6)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>A select group, at ease in their positions at the head of the nation, is portrayed here. They display not a tremor of fear that they and the nation they lead could become victims of war and violence. Rather, Israel’s leaders remain on a track that invites disaster by ignoring it. Images convey a surreal existence of untroubled leisure that the prospect of the “collapse of Joseph” does not disturb. The Hebrew word translated “collapse” means, literally, “breaking” or “fracture.” It could refer here both to the breakdown of communal <page id="p43"/>sensibility in Israel and to its inevitable result: the shattering of the kingdom itself by invading armies (Amos 3:11).</p>
      <p>The following oracle names this sense of entitlement and immunity from disaster “the pride of Jacob.”</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>The Lord God has sworn by his very self—</slf>
        <sl1>oracle of the Lord, the God of hosts:</sl1>
        <sl>I abhor the pride of Jacob,</sl>
        <sl1>I hate his strongholds,</sl1>
        <sl1l>and I will hand over the city with everything in it. (Amos 6:8)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The word translated “pride” (literally, “exaltation”) derives from a Hebrew verb that means “to rise up.” The phrase “pride of Jacob” might ordinarily signify something praiseworthy but here represents what is odious. Israel’s pride is linked with its strongholds, symbols of military might and security, but also of insularity and wrongdoing (Amos 3:11; 5:9).</p>
      <p>Such arrogance is challenged as an aberration of the natural order and connected with the overturning of justice and righteousness.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Can horses run over rock,</slf>
        <sl1>and can one plow the sea with oxen?</sl1>

        <sl1l>and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood. (Amos 6:12)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>Only a deluded person or nation would defy the limits of reality by driving horses over a cliff (rock) or attempting to plow the sea. By twisting justice and righteousness into something poisonous and deadly, however, the Israelites have defied the parameters of God’s just order (cf. Amos 5:7).</p>
      <p><page id="p44"/>That the pride of Jacob has grown into an exaggerated trust in human decisions is clear in a second condemnation in Amos 8.</p>

        <sl>It will all rise up and toss like the Nile,</sl>

        <sl1l>and in broad daylight cover the land with darkness. (Amos 8:7–9)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The imagery suggests both an earthquake and a solar eclipse. Each signals an upending of the normal order in creation, paralleling the elevation of human faculties over divine oversight. God’s aversion to the pride of Jacob in these oracles can be traced to Israel’s lack of fear of (reverence for) the power of divine presence in the world.</p>
      <ah id="ah0209">The Dimension of Patience in Divine Justice (Amos 7—8)</ah>
      <paft>The four prophetic visions in Amos 7–8 trace a pattern of divine forbearance giving way to judgment. The brevity of the visions makes the unfolding of the pattern clear. First is the vision of God forming a swarm of locusts, which will devour the grass of the earth (Amos 7:1–3). The image of God “forming” the locusts brings to mind God’s creative powers as “the one who forms mountains” (Amos 4:13). The <page id="p45"/>phrase “the grass of the earth” carries global resonance as well.<fnref idref="fn16">16</fnref> In the face of massive loss, the prophetic voice cries out to God, “Forgive!” Israel is personified as the ancestor Jacob in this plea: a small, marginal figure whom no one but God would protect in the face of such a catastrophe. The prophetic appeal recognizes Israel’s frailty and need of God’s help, and it moves God to relent.<fnref idref="fn17">17</fnref></paft>
      <p>The same scenario is repeated in the next vision, which follows directly (Amos 7:4–6). Here the Lord calls for a fire of such ferocity that it will consume not only fields but the “great abyss,” either the deep waters under the earth or the sea itself (Amos 7:4–6). The scope and depth of God’s creative powers are clearly displayed, and the prophet reacts with an urgent “Cease!” The intensification of both catastrophe and prophetic response suggests that there has been no significant change in Israel following God’s reprieve in the first vision. By again drawing God’s attention to Israel’s smallness, however, the appeal succeeds in staying the divine hand a second time.</p>
      <p>In the third vision, the dynamic shifts, with prophetic appeal stilled and God speaking rather than listening. The Lord stands by a wall holding a plummet (plumb line), a cord held taut by a metal weight to determine alignment. This time God challenges the prophet: “What do you see, Amos?” When Amos responds, “A plummet,” the Lord forestalls any appeal:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>See I am laying the plummet</slf>
        <sl1>in the midst of my people Israel;</sl1>
        <sl1>I will forgive them no longer.</sl1>
        <sl><page id="p46"/>The high places of Isaac shall be laid waste,</sl>
        <sl1>and the sanctuaries of Israel made desolate;</sl1>
        <sl1l>and I will attack the house of Jeroboam with the sword. (Amos 7:8–9)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The plummet indicates how far the kingdom of Israel has shifted away from the standard of divine justice (cf. Isa 28:17). The phrase “in your midst” recalls the presence of God dwelling in the sanctuary in the midst of the community, but only to undercut any expectation of gracious protection (cf. Amos 5:17). Now the Lord declares, “I will forgive them no longer” or, literally, “I will not pass by them again.” The Hebrew verb translated “pass by” can mean “to overlook” or, by extension, “to forgive,” but it is also used in the literal sense to describe God’s appearances to Moses (Exod 33:18–23; 34:5–7) and to the prophet Elijah (1 Kgs 19:11) on the summit of God’s holy mountain. In the case of each, the Lord “passes by” so that they can encounter the divine presence. The statement “I will not pass by them again,” then, could also mean that God will no longer be present to the Israelites.</p>
      <p>In this vision, the sanctuaries of Isaac (Jacob’s father) and Israel (another name for Jacob) are targeted for judgment. These are sites where the Israelites have paid tribute to God in ritual but disdained the practice of justice (Amos 5:18–24). The phrase “high places” could also imply the supplication of foreign gods and the inclusion of their rituals, as elsewhere in the Old Testament.<fnref idref="fn18">18</fnref></p>
      <p>God’s unrelenting shift to judgment in the third vision sets the scene for a narrative interlude about the repudiation of prophetic warning by a spiritual leader of Israel (Amos 7:10–17). Amaziah, priest of the major northern <page id="p47"/>sanctuary of Bethel, dismisses Amos as a political conspirator from Judah and a threat Israel’s current king, Jeroboam. Although he stands at the head of the religious hierarchy in the Northern Kingdom, Amaziah subordinates openness to the divine word spoken through the prophet to the stability of the royal dynasty. He sends Amos away without a hearing: “Never again prophesy in Bethel, for it is the king’s sanctuary and a royal temple” (Amos 7:13).</p>
      <p>This brief interlude suggests that the banishment of the prophetic voice from a sanctuary dedicated to God plays a central role in the depletion of divine patience. The fourth vision leaves no question about the divine intent.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>The end has come for my people Israel;</slf>
        <sl1>I will forgive them no longer.</sl1>
        <sl>The temple singers will wail on that day—</sl>
        <sl1>oracle of the Lord God.</sl1>
        <sl>Many shall be the corpses,</sl>
        <sl1l>strewn everywhere—Silence! (Amos 8:2–3)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>These words echo the third vision of judgment and magnify the sense of divine absence. If the community of Israel continues to disintegrate, God cannot be present to it. And if the community’s spiritual leaders shut out prophetic words of warning, divine communication ceases. In this fourth vision, as in the third, the breakdown of Israel’s relation to God is shown in the domain of ritual worship, a primary means of communication with the divine presence. The choir of singers in the sanctuary will lament the ghastly evidence of death in Israel, but the Lord will respond only by demanding silence.</p>
      <p>Divine justice in these four visions is patient in the sense that God responds to prophetic appeal and initially holds back judgment, allowing for a succession of visionary <page id="p48"/>warnings and intervals of time between them. If the prophetic voice finds no hearing, however, there can be no human response to God’s words, and unjust practices will continue to preclude just ones. Divine forbearance will find no path forward, and the immediate prospect becomes the withdrawal of God from interaction with Israel. This will mean not only the loss of nation and land, but of any further communication from God.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>See, days are coming—oracle of the Lord God—</slf>
        <sl1>when I will send a famine upon the land:</sl1>
        <sl>Not a hunger for bread, or a thirst for water,</sl>
        <sl1>but for hearing the word of the Lord.</sl1>
        <sl>They shall stagger from sea to sea</sl>
        <sl1>and wander from north to east</sl1>
        <sl>In search of the word of the Lord,</sl>
        <sl1l>but they shall not find it. (Amos 8:11–12)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>In this scenario, the previous dynamic of response is reversed. The people wander about seeking a word of assurance or guidance from God but cannot hear one. The oracle does not suggest that in this pursuit they have altered their ways of thinking and acting. It does, however, envision a movement toward God, one that compels patience, this time, from the community.</p>
      <ah id="ah0210">The Dimension of Calibration in Divine Justice (Amos 9:1–10)</ah>
      <paft>The fifth and final vision of Amos portends a universal judgment, from which none will escape. It begins with the demolition of an unnamed sanctuary.</paft>
      <senseline>
        <slf><page id="p49"/>I saw the Lord standing beside the altar. And 	he said:</slf>
        <sl1>Strike the capitals, so that the threshold shakes!</sl1>
        <sl>Break them off on the heads of them all!</sl>
        <sl1>Those who are left I will slay with the sword.</sl1>
        <sl>Not one shall get away,</sl>
        <sl1>no survivor shall escape.</sl1>
        <sl>Though they dig down to Sheol,</sl>
        <sl1>even from there my hand shall take them;</sl1>
        <sl>Though they climb to the heavens,</sl>
        <sl1>even from there I shall bring them down.</sl1>
        <sl>Though they hide on the summit of Carmel,</sl>
        <sl1>there, too, I will hunt them down and take them;</sl1>
        <sl>Though they hide from my gaze at the bottom of 	the sea,</sl>
        <sl1>there I will command the serpent to bite them.</sl1>
        <sl>Though they go into captivity before their 	enemies,</sl>
        <sl1>there I will command the sword to slay them.</sl1>
        <sl>I will fix my gaze upon them</sl>
        <sl1l>for evil and not for good. (Amos 9:1–4)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The sanctuary looms in this vision as the target of judgment, as if the entire nation has become absorbed into a site that manifests its distorted understanding of God. It is easy to hear in the Lord’s call to decapitate the temple’s columns a metaphorical connection with the nation’s leaders. Just as the falling capitals crush those assembled in the sanctuary, the death of Israel’s leaders entails the death of those they lead. The shaking of the sanctuary threshold, as if in an earthquake, suggests the breaking up of the entire structure, <page id="p50"/>so that there will no longer be a point of entry. Israel as a nation will be reduced to rubble.<fnref idref="fn19">19</fnref></p>
      <p>The cosmic scope of divine judgment is evident in this vision. God’s eyes, hand, and command reach the heights, depths, and corners of creation to accost those for whom judgment is due. At the same time the reference to those hiding on the top of Mount Carmel locates divine activity in the Northern Kingdom, and the mention of captivity, where God’s command to destroy will persist, points to the exile of the kingdom’s inhabitants. The divine intent is bluntly stated: to bring harm, not good, to all adherents of the cult and culture of the Northern Kingdom.</p>
      <p>The universality and finality of judgment in this concluding vision is borne out by an affirmation of divine activity that emphasizes God’s capacity to de-create as well as create and echoes the acclamations of divine power in Amos 4:13; 5:8–9; and 8:8–9. It begins with an image of cosmic upheaval and mourning.</p>

      <p><page id="p51"/>At the same time the prophetic voice suggests that divine justice is not indiscriminate or final but calibrated.</p>

        <sl1>oracle of the Lord.</sl1>
        <sl>For see, I have given the command</sl>
        <sl1>to sift the house of Israel among all the nations,</sl1>
        <sl>As one sifts with a sieve,</sl>
        <sl1>letting no pebble fall to the ground.</sl1>
        <sl>All sinners among my people shall die by the sword,</sl>
        <sl1l>those who say, “Disaster will not reach or overtake us.” (Amos 9:8–10)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The reason the Northern Kingdom faces obliteration is that it is judged to be “sinful.” This adjective derives from a Hebrew verbal root that means “to sin” in the sense of “to miss the way” or “to go wrong.” As a kingdom, Israel has lost its way, yet God’s judgment is ultimately directed toward those who are sinners “among my people.” The preceding prophetic speeches suggest that these are primarily the nation’s economic, political, and religious leaders, who are wrapped up in securing their own advantage and position and say in their arrogance, “Disaster will not overtake us.”</p>
      <p>The statement “I will not destroy the house of Jacob completely” implies that sinners do not make up the whole community, however. “The “house of Jacob” and the “house of Israel” are not synonymous with the Northern Kingdom. Jacob is the ancestor of the twelve tribes of Israel, including Judah, and Jacob’s “house” includes all his descendants, from the first generations into the future. Those in the Northern <page id="p52"/>Kingdom who are accused and condemned do not represent all who live there, as the distinction between abusers and abused in the initial oracle on Israel makes clear (Amos 2:6–8). The “house of Jacob” is not a political entity.</p>
      <p>The image of God sifting the house of Israel with a sieve conveys meticulous discernment. That the divine sifting of the Israelites takes place “among all the nations” suggests that this discernment will occur after the kingdom’s defeat and the scattering of its peoples among foreign lands.<fnref idref="fn20">20</fnref> Massive relocation will not signal the end of the ancestral household of Israel and its sacred traditions. As if with a threshing sieve used for sorting grain from detritus, God will let the grain fall to the ground but trap every pebble that would mar the harvest. Each grain will bear the potential not only to nourish but to be replanted as seed.</p>
      <p>Despite the reality that all in the Northern Kingdom of Israel (and, in time, all in the Southern Kingdom of Judah) will suffer the impact of divine judgment, God’s justice in Amos is ultimately calibrated. The survivors among the house of Jacob will be those who acknowledge that the Lord of hosts protects the divine order in which justice on earth is rooted and who reflect this order in the way they live together as a “house,” or familial community.</p>
      <ah id="ah0211">Epilogue: The Regenerative Dimension of Divine Justice (AMOS 9:11–15)</ah>
      <paft>The conclusion, or epilogue, of the Book of Amos foresees the eventual outcome of divine justice as a transformation <page id="p53"/>of the land of Israel. This transformation stems from God’s gracious activity, and its extravagant images bespeak divine generosity.</paft>
      <senseline>
        <slf>On that day I will raise up</slf>
        <sl1>the fallen hut of David;</sl1>

        <sl1>and rebuild it as in the days of old,</sl1>
        <sl>That they may possess the remnant of Edom,</sl>
        <sl1>and all nations claimed in my name—</sl1>

        <sl>The mountains shall drip with the juice of 	grapes,</sl>
        <sl1>and all the hills shall run with it.</sl1>
        <sl>I will restore my people Israel,</sl>
        <sl1>they shall rebuild and inhabit their ruined cities,</sl1>
        <sl>Plant vineyards and drink the wine,</sl>
        <sl1>set out gardens and eat the fruits.</sl1>
        <sl>I will plant them upon their own ground;</sl>
        <sl1>never again shall they be plucked</sl1>
        <sl>From the land I have given them—</sl>
        <sl1l>the Lord, your God, has spoken. (Amos 9:11–15)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>After the dark vortex of Amos’s final vision and the oblique promise of survival for some that follows, the shift toward proclamation of new life for Israel is unexpected. <page id="p54"/>At an undefined time in the future (“on that day”), God will act decisively for good, not harm, reversing previous dire warnings about the “day of the Lord” (Amos 5:18–20; 9:4).</p>
      <p>Transformation begins with repairing the “fallen hut of David,” that is, the divided kingdoms of north and south. All twelve tribes of Israel will be joined together under a Davidic king, returning to an earlier tradition of leadership (“as in the days of old”). The kingdom will expand its borders into territories designated by tradition as belonging to the Davidic kingdom, including what is left of the territory of neighboring Edom, in the south.<fnref idref="fn21">21</fnref> Scenes of unprecedented agricultural abundance in the land convey the reversal of Israel’s devastation. In their oblivion, sinners within the old Israel claimed, “Disaster will not overtake us” (Amos 9:10). In a renewed Israel, sowing and reaping, harvesting and planting create a continuous cycle of abundance so luxuriant that the mountains and hills will drip and flow with wine.</p>
      <p>At the core of God’s promises is a return to equilibrium and well-being: “I will restore my people Israel.” The Hebrew wording states, literally, “I will turn back the captivity of my people Israel.” The verb “turn back” or “return” (<theb>s̆ûb</theb>) reverses God’s refusal to turn judgment back in the oracles against the nations, Judah, and Israel (Amos 1:3—2:16) and also reverses the consequences of Israel’s repeated refusal to return to the Lord (Amos 4:6–11). Now the people will rebuild life in their ruined cities, cultivate vineyards and gardens, and enjoy the fruits of their work. God will <page id="p55"/>replant them on their own land so that they will never be uprooted from it again (cf. Hos 2:25; 14:6–8).</p>
      <p>The conclusion of Amos implies that, in the long term, divine justice is regenerative. The outcome of God’s judgment on human injustice is the remaking of the human community in a way that brings unity, peace, and the flourishing of what is needed for life to all. This remaking comes about through the merciful agency of God, yet it follows a long series of oracles of judgment. The sequence implies both that human acceptance of the reality of a just divine order precedes the experience of divine mercy and that such acceptance is possible (Amos 9:10).</p>
      <ah id="ah0212">The Interface of Divine Justice and Mercy in Amos</ah>
      <paft>Multiple dimensions of divine justice are enfolded in the Book of Amos. Together they affirm the existence of fundamental boundaries integral to the divine order. The major thrust of Amos is to move its audiences to grasp the grave consequences of practices that violate these boundaries, desecrating the name and worship of God. The opening lines of the book convey this gravity: “The Lord roars from Zion…and the summit of Carmel withers” (Amos 1:2).</paft>
      <p>The demands of divine justice in Amos entail more than recognizing boundaries, however. Fundamental to justice are both profound respect for God’s role in the cosmic order and awareness of the inherence of mercy in it. Divine justice calls for compassion between nations and within the community of Israel, especially for those who are vulnerable and in need.</p>
      <p>In the opening set of oracles concerning the nations that neighbor Israel, the basis of judgment is cruelty in battle. <page id="p56"/>The oracles against Edom and Tyre highlight the absence of compassion between nations, especially between those who share close ties of commitment (Amos 1:9–12). The oracles against Israel fault the prosperous for suppressing pity toward members of their own community, whom they enslave and abuse (Amos 2:6–8; 4:1; 6:1–6). In their indifference they have failed to mirror God’s mercy toward them when they were enslaved and homeless. A deep-seated relational disjunction lies at the root of the Israelites’ distance from God, and it is a basic dimension of divine judgment.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the enactment of judgment in Amos involves more than simple condemnation. The natural and human catastrophes that befall Israel in Amos 4:6–11 are intended as warnings to awaken the leaders of the Northern Kingdom to the full extent of divine justice. An alternative to hardship and death is raised in the prophetic appeals to “Seek the Lord, that you may live” and “Seek good and not evil, that you may live,” because it is possible that the Lord will show mercy to the survivors of disaster (Amos 5:6, 14–15). In these ways God attempts to communicate to the Israelites, nonverbally and verbally, how divine justice and mercy work.</p>
      <p>Even when there is no human response, divine justice is patient, as the prophetic visions in Amos 7:1–9 suggest. God relents from imposing judgment when moved by prophetic appeals that highlight Israel’s helplessness. Divine justice allows postponement and second chances, and in this respect, also, the dimension of mercy is incorporated into divine justice.</p>
      <p>In the last of Amos’s visions, God will ultimately redress injustice by dismantling its human structures (Amos 9:1–4). The Northern Kingdom has evolved into a sinful kingdom (Amos 9:8) and will fall according to the logic of its own operating principles, by which the strong take advantage of <page id="p57"/>the weak. God does not, however, ignore those who have suffered from the perversion of justice. Judgment ultimately falls on those who merit the label “sinner” by denying the consequences of their habitual wrongdoing (Amos 9:10; cf. 6:1–7). The image of God sifting pebbles from grain (Amos 9:10) suggests that divine justice is calibrated in terms of human recognition of God’s role in the cosmic order.</p>
      <p>Despite God’s apparent withdrawal and silence for a time (Amos 8:11–12), the enactment of divine justice leads to new life for Israel. The conclusion of Amos in 9:11–15 envisions the Israelites replanted on their land according to a pattern of abundance and safety for all. The ultimate outpouring of divine generosity and its life-changing impact is also a dimension of divine justice in the Book of Amos.</p>
      <p>The merciful aspects of God’s interactions with the Northern Kingdom stand in striking contrast to the apathy displayed within it. Israel has failed to sound the depths and breadth of what divine justice demands and as a result has failed to care for the weak and lowly in its midst. Those who are condemned in Amos are those “not made ill by the collapse of Joseph” (Amos 6:6), neither by the current disintegration of Israel as a community nor by the prospect of the eradication of the kingdom. The Book of Amos proclaims that a nation that does not care enough about its own people, its own future, or its own God will experience divine justice that is both grounded in mercy and enfolded with mercy.</p>

      <ct>Divine Justice and Mercy in Hosea</ct>
      <ahaft id="ahaft0301">About Hosea</ahaft>
      <pf>The pronouncement of judgment on the Northern Kingdom of Israel is forceful in the Book of Hosea and all the more disturbing because of its personal tone. Hosea frequently represents divine speech in the first person, addresses Israel with the personal name “Ephraim,” and compares the relationship between God and Israel to marriage and parenthood. Figurative speech, imagery, and word play in Hosea invite audiences to engage their own experiences with the prophetic portrayal of Israel’s history with God.</pf>
      <p>Hosea draws out the implications of Amos’s accusations of Israel, attributing the corrupt and chaotic state of the Northern Kingdom to the people’s lack of “knowledge of God,” or failure to acknowledge their essential relationship with God.<fnref idref="fn22">22</fnref> This lack is especially poignant in Hosea’s evocations of an intimate relationship between God and Israel, metaphorically akin to the bond between spouses or between parent and child. In this relationship, divine justice and mercy are interwoven in an interplay that is presented differently in the various segments<page id="p59"/> of the book. These segments include the symbolic marriage between God and Israel (Hos 1—3); oracles of judgment on Israel’s leaders (Hos 4—5); oracles of judgment on Israel as a people (Hos 6—10); the parent-child bond between God and Israel (Hos 11); the personification of Israel as Ephraim (Hos 12:1—14:9); and the epilogue to the book (Hos 14:10).</p>
      <p>In contrast to Amos, the Book of Hosea draws more attention to the pervasive state of corruption in Israel than to specific offenses. The flashpoint of Israel’s corruption is its pursuit of favors from alien deities and foreign powers that promise direct access to agricultural prosperity and military security. The oracles of judgment in Hosea repeatedly call out as prostitution the worship of the Canaanite fertility god Baal as well as Israel’s pursuit of alliances with the kings of Egypt and Assyria.</p>
      <p>Hosea creates a more complex picture of communal degeneration than does Amos. The people of the Northern Kingdom have been misled by their priests, who have failed to teach them the essence of their relationship with God, as well as by their kings and princes, who have set a disastrous course for the nation. The people consequently have fallen into deviant patterns of behavior that have entrapped them: “Their deeds do not allow them to return to their God” (Hos 5:4). Depicting the community’s inability to change elicits divine pity alongside fierce announcements of judgment. Expressions of the desire to heal reveal the mercy God would like to show Israel and convey regret for lost possibility.</p>
      <p>The first verse, or superscription, of the Book of Hosea gives less information about the prophetic speaker than does the superscription of Amos. Hosea is identified only as the son of Beeri, an otherwise unknown biblical name. In terms of a timeline, the first verse states that the word of the Lord came to Hosea during the reigns of the Kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah in Judah and the reign of King <page id="p60"/>Jeroboam II over Israel. The list of Judean kings indicates a longer period of activity for this prophetic figure than for Amos, extending into the politically unstable years leading up to the last days of the Northern Kingdom and possibly beyond. Prophetic oracles in Hosea that refer to treachery among the princes of Israel and questionable diplomatic bargains with Assyria and Egypt to stave off invasion would fit this time (cf. 2 Kgs 15:17–31; 17:1–5).</p>
      <p>Recurrent invocations of “Ephraim,” the ancestor of a major northern tribe, further fix the prophetic focus of Hosea on the Northern Kingdom. Even more than in Amos, however, the oracles of Hosea refer to parallel misdoings and judgment in Judah, indicating a legacy that extends beyond the collapse of Ephraim as a nation.<fnref idref="fn23">23</fnref></p>
      <ah id="ah0301">Prologue: The Continuum of Divine Justice and Mercy (Hosea 1—3)</ah>
      <paft>The first three chapters of Hosea serve as a prologue to the book, sketching a sequence of divine justice followed by divine mercy. Each of the three develops the metaphor of a marriage between God and the people of Israel distinctively, featuring different facets of Israel’s estrangement from and reconciliation with God.</paft>
      <bh id="bh0301">The Symbolic Act of the Prophet (Hosea 1:1—2:3)</bh>
      <paft>Hosea 1—3 begins with an unusual divine instruction to the prophet: “Go, get for yourself a woman of prostitution…, <page id="p61"/>for the land prostitutes itself, turning away from the Lord” (1:2). This command brings into focus the Israelites’ enthrallment to alien gods and foreign powers. The scenario of a prophet marrying a woman who will not remain faithful once married sharpens the thrust of the spoken word. Like other prophetic symbolic acts, it is intended to shake audiences into awareness of what is happening around them.<fnref idref="fn24">24</fnref></paft>
      <p>The focus of the narrative quickly shifts from the marriage itself to the names of the children of this alliance, that is, to the next generation. Each name represents the Israel of the present day. The Lord names the first child Jezreel, “for in a little while I will punish the house of Jehu for the bloodshed at Jezreel and bring to an end the kingdom of the house of Israel; on that day I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel” (Hos 1:4). The house of Jehu refers to a dynastic line of northern kings. The founder of this line, Jehu, was a military commander who seized power by shooting (with his bow) the reigning king in the valley of Jezreel and then ordering the beheading of the king’s children in the royal city of Jezreel (2 Kgs 9—10). The name “Jezreel” means “God sows” and conveys the agricultural abundance of a region that has now become a symbol of regicide and bloodshed. God will “break the bow,” or weaponry, of Israel there.</p>
      <p>The name of the second child conveys the impartiality of God’s justice: “Give her the name ‘Not-Pitied,’ for I will no longer feel pity for the house of Israel: rather, I will utterly abhor them” (Hos 1:6). This rejection implies that God has shown pity for Israel in the past but will do so no longer. The Hebrew verbs translated “pitied” and “pity” derive from the word for “womb” (<theb>reḥem</theb>) and carry associations of familial <page id="p62"/>attachment that the name “Not-Pitied” annuls. The naming of the third child reinforces the sense of rupture: “Give him the name ‘Not-My-People,’ for you are not my people, and I am not ‘I am’ for you” (Hos 1:9).</p>
      <p>The phrase “I am” recalls the tradition reflected in Exodus 3, where God declares to Moses from the burning bush, “I am who am….This is what you will tell the Israelites: I AM has sent me to you” (Exod 3:14). Part of the significance of this name in Exodus is that God will be vitally present to Moses and to the whole people of Israel as they leave Egypt for the unknown: “I will be with you” (Exod 3:12). Such assurance is withdrawn in the first chapter of Hosea. Israel is no longer God’s people: they are on their own.</p>
      <p>This harsh announcement of separation is followed by a divine oracle of promise that stands in sharp contrast. The promise lies in the future, at a time when the now separate kingdoms of Judah and Israel will join together under one ruler. It speaks of a full reconciliation between God and a reunited people who will no longer be known as “Not-My-People,” but as “children of the living God” (Hos 2:1) and “My People” (Hos 2:3). They will also bear the name of God’s compassion for them, “Pitied” (Hos 2:3). This people will rise up from the land, fulfilling the meaning of Jezreel, “God sows” (Hos 2:2).</p>
      <p>The metaphor of the marriage between God and Israel in Hosea 1:2—2:3 sets a template of estrangement as prelude to a reconciliation in which the whole people of Israel are affirmed as offspring of God and assured of divine mercy. Hosea 2:4–25 and Hosea 3 expand on this template in different ways.</p>

      <paft>The next segment of the prologue adds complexity to the marriage metaphor by personifying the physical land of Israel as a woman and anthropomorphizing God as her spouse. This set of oracles, in which God speaks in the first person, focuses on the relationship of wife and husband. Its link to the previous segment is evident in God’s opening appeal to the children of the marriage.</paft>

      <pcon>God asks the children, the generation who will bear the brunt of divine rejection, to reproach their mother and press her to cease her prostitution with other gods.</pcon>
      <box>
        <bxh>Prostitution in the Old Testament</bxh>
        <bxf>In many biblical texts prostitution is an accepted reality of life. Tamar dresses herself as a prostitute to get the attention of her father-in-law Judah along the roadside (Gen 38). The prostitute Rahab shelters Israelite spies in the city of Jericho (Josh 2). One of the early tribal leaders of Israel, Jephthah, is <page id="p64"/>the son of a prostitute (Judg 11:1), and the hero Samson visited a prostitute in the Philistine city of Gaza (Judg 16:1). King Solomon’s famous judgment was between two prostitutes who each claimed the same baby as her own (1 Kgs 3:16–28).</bxf>
        <bx>Prostitution is not generally regarded as a suitable occupation for women in the Bible, although a woman may be sold into or reduced to prostitution (Amos 7:17). In the legal tradition of Deuteronomy, the fees of a prostitute are not acceptable as offerings in the temple because such “things are an abomination to the Lord, your God” (Deut 23:19). It is within the law for a woman who is proved to have had sexual relations before marriage to be cast off by her husband and stoned to death “because she committed a shameful crime in Israel by prostituting herself in her father’s house” (Deut 22:21).</bx>
        <bxl>In Hosea adultery and prostitution are paralleled (Hos 2:4; 4:13–14). Similarly, the married woman who seeks to seduce the young man in Proverbs 7 dresses as a harlot, or prostitute (Prov 7:10; see also Prov 6:26). Many biblical texts in addition to Hosea use the analogy of prostitution for the enthrallment of Israel and Judah to other deities and idolatrous rituals (see, e.g., Mic 1:6–7; Deut 31:16; Judg 2:17; 8:27, 33).</bxl>
      </box>
      <p>The spotlight then moves toward God’s own confrontation with the mother. In what follows Israel is personified both as a wife and as the land itself. Unless the children can convince their mother to renounce her prostitution, God will denude the land by means of a severe drought.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Or I will strip her naked,</slf>
        <sl1>leaving her as on the day of her birth;</sl1>
        <sl><page id="p65"/>I will make her like the wilderness,</sl>
        <sl1>make her like an arid land,</sl1>
        <sl1l>and let her die of thirst. (Hos 2:5)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The image of Israel stripped naked, as a prostitute strips for her clients, echoes traditional ancient Near Eastern curses that threaten a potential adversary with being forced into prostitution and shamefully exposed (cf. Amos 7:17).<fnref idref="fn26">26</fnref> The following verses depict the nature of Israel’s prostitution with analogies that shift between the figure of the prostitute wife and that of the land itself.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Yes, their mother has prostituted herself;</slf>
        <sl1>she who conceived them has acted shamefully.</sl1>
        <sl>For she said, “I will go after my lovers,</sl>
        <sl1>who give me my bread and my water,</sl1>
        <sl1>my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.”</sl1>
        <sl>Therefore, I will hedge in her way with thorns</sl>
        <sl1>and erect a wall against her,</sl1>
        <sl1>so that she cannot find her paths.</sl1>
        <sl>If she runs after her lovers, she will not overtake 	them;</sl>
        <sl1>if she seeks them, she will not find them.</sl1>
        <sl>Therefore she will say,</sl>
        <sl1>“I will go back to my first husband,</sl1>
        <sl1l>for I was better off then than now.” (Hos 2:7–9)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>At the crux of the Israelites’ prostitution are “lovers” from whom they hope to gain better agricultural harvests. Given the dependence of their semiarid land on rain, the <page id="p66"/>people appeal to manifestations of the Canaanite god of the rainstorm, Baal. In this they deny the reality that it is their own God who both sends rain and withholds it. If God sends drought to strip the land of its yield so that only thorns thrive, the people will realize that the path to prosperity through Baal is a dead end (cf. Hos 2:14).</p>
      <p>These verses suggest an instructive dimension to the experience of deprivation. Through it the wife (Israel) will learn the futility of pursuing other lovers, or deities. She will recognize that her “first husband” is the one she can count on, even if drier seasons alternate with rainier seasons in the land. The people’s experience of helplessness will turn them back in the direction of their God.<fnref idref="fn27">27</fnref></p>
      <p>The next verses make explicit the theme of Israel’s ignorance about its relationship with God:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>She did not know</slf>
        <sl1>that it was I who gave her</sl1>
        <sl1>the grain, the wine, and the oil,</sl1>
        <sl>I who lavished upon her silver, and gold</sl>
        <sl1>which they used for Baal,</sl1>
        <sl>Therefore I will take back my grain in its time,</sl>
        <sl1>and my wine in its season;</sl1>
        <sl>I will snatch away my wool and my flax,</sl>
        <sl1>which were to cover her nakedness.</sl1>
        <sl>Now I will lay bare her shame</sl>
        <sl1>in full view of her lovers,</sl1>
        <sl1l>and no one can deliver her out of my hand. (Hos 2:10–12)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The marriage metaphor envisions the people of Israel <page id="p67"/>in an intimate union with their divine spouse, yet they do not acknowledge that the gifts of the land that sustain them stem from this relationship.<fnref idref="fn28">28</fnref> Ironically, these gifts include even the silver and gold the people misuse to make statues for the worship of Baal (idols). As a consequence of turning to Baal for what they need, they will lose even the wool and flax that clothe them, exposing their vulnerability.</p>
      <p>The image of Israel’s nakedness evokes brutal punishment but also pathos, and it prepares the ground for the declaration of God’s intent to lead the people to a more hopeful resolution.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Therefore, I will allure her now;</slf>
        <sl1>I will lead her into the wilderness</sl1>
        <sl1>and speak persuasively to her.</sl1>
        <sl>Then I will give her the vineyards she had,</sl>
        <sl1>and the valley of Achor as a door of hope.</sl1>
        <sl>There she will respond as in the days of her 	youth,</sl>
        <sl1l>as on the day when she came up from the land of Egypt. (Hos 2:16–17)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>Like a lover, God will draw Israel into the wilderness, a deserted place without the allurements of abundance, and will literally “speak to her heart” there. In Hebrew, the heart represents the center of the conscious, relational human self. In a metaphor of human courtship, God will woo the people of Israel and persuade them to embrace the divine presence.</pcon>
      <p>The setting of the wilderness again recalls traditions of the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt. Barren as the desert might seem, the people grew in knowledge of God there as they were led by the divine cloud. This memory will be <page id="p68"/>revived in a new time of deprivation and dependence on divine guidance.</p>
      <p>The end of the exodus journey is recalled in the bestowal of gifts that anticipate new life in the land: vineyards and hope.<fnref idref="fn29">29</fnref> Along with God’s words, these gifts are intended to remind Israel of the days when the people followed God and left Egypt behind. In a time far removed from “the days of the Baals” (Hos 2:15), God will move Israel to recognize and respond to divine care.</p>
      <p>The sequence of remaining oracles in Hosea 2 speaks of this future time. What God will do for Israel “on that day” is laid out in a series of promises.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>I will make a covenant for them on that day,</slf>
        <sl1>with the wild animals,</sl1>
        <sl>With the birds of the air,</sl>
        <sl1>and with the things that crawl on the ground.</sl1>
        <sl>Bow and sword and warfare</sl>
        <sl1>I will destroy from the land,</sl1>
        <sl1>and I will give them rest in safety.</sl1>
        <sl>I will betroth you to me forever:</sl>
        <sl1>I will betroth me to you with justice and with judgment,</sl1>
        <sl1>with loyalty and with compassion;</sl1>
        <sl>I will betroth you to me with fidelity,</sl>
        <sl1l>and you shall know the Lord. (Hos 2:20–22)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>Israel will not only be led from the desert to the land; the land will become a place of safety. God will make a covenant, or pact, with all the untamed creatures that live there to ensure <page id="p69"/>that none does harm. The second divine act will be to destroy “bow and sword and warfare” from the land, protecting it from human enemies. This promise counters God’s earlier determination to “break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel,” ensuring Israel’s defeat in battle (Hos 1:5).<fnref idref="fn30">30</fnref> Merciful deliverance will counterbalance divine justice.</pcon>
      <p>This yoking of divine justice and mercy in the metaphorical narrative is explicit in the sequence of qualities with which God will betroth Israel again. At the head of the list are “justice and judgment” (<theb>ṣedeq</theb> and <theb>mišpāṭ</theb>),<fnref idref="fn31">31</fnref> followed by loyalty, compassion, and fidelity. The Hebrew noun translated “loyalty” (<theb>ḥesed</theb>) conveys the kindness shown to those with whom one is joined in a committed relationship. It is often translated as “mercy” and is paired in this passage with “compassion” (<theb>raḥǎmîm</theb>), which implies close, familial-like ties (cf. Amos 1:11). “Fidelity” indicates endurance in such a relationship. These five qualities are interwoven like multiple strands to form a strong bond in which the people Israel will finally acknowledge their relation to the Lord.</p>
      <box>
        <bxh><theb>Ḥesed</theb>: Loyalty and Mercy</bxh>
        <bxf>The Hebrew noun <theb>ḥesed</theb> is multifaceted, encompassing the concepts of both loyalty and mercy. It expresses the kindness and mercy shown another or others with whom one is closely tied, whether within a family or through some other bond <page id="p70"/>(see, e.g., the pledge of mutual kindness between Rahab, a Canaanite woman, and the Israelite spies in Josh 2:12–14). In the NABRE translation of Hosea, <theb>ḥesed</theb> is translated as “loyalty” (Hos 2:21; 4:1; 6:4, 6; 10:12; 12:7) but often elsewhere in the NABRE as “mercy.” The ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament known as the Septuagint (LXX), consistently uses a word for “mercy” to represent <theb>ḥesed</theb>.</bxf>
        <bx>Many of the contexts in which <theb>ḥesed</theb> appears indicate that mercy is invoked within a relationship that presumes steadfast commitment, or loyalty. The word <theb>ḥesed</theb> is often paired with “faithfulness” in the psalms and elsewhere, for example (cf. Pss 36:6; 57:11; 98:3; 100:5; 117:2; 138:2).</bx>
        <bxl>In the Book of Hosea, the Israelites’ loyal commitment (<theb>ḥesed</theb>) to God and God’s ways is an acknowledgment of God’s mercy or kindness (<theb>ḥesed</theb>) toward them. The lack of loyalty is linked to the absence of knowledge of God in Hosea 4:1. (cf. Hos 2:21–22).</bxl>
      </box>
      <p>The divine qualities that join God and people will ensue in a dynamic chain of life-giving response throughout the cosmos.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>On that day I will respond—oracle of the Lord—</slf>
        <sl1>I will respond to the heavens,</sl1>

        <sl>The earth will respond to the grain, and wine, 	and oil,</sl>
        <sl1>and these will respond to Jezreel.</sl1>
        <sl>I will sow her for myself in the land,</sl>
        <sl1>and I will have pity on Not-Pitied.</sl1>
        <sl>I will say to Not-My-People, “You are my 	people,”</sl>

      <p><page id="p71"/>God’s response prompts the heavens to send rain on the earth, the soaked earth to nurture the vegetation that is rooted in it, and the fruits of this vegetation to sustain the people of Israel. God will plant the people back in the land, and the name “Jezreel,” will once again mean “God sows” (cf. Amos 9:15).<fnref idref="fn32">32</fnref> The second and third children of Hosea’s symbolic marriage will be renamed “Pitied” and “You are my people,” as the latter answers, “My God!,” sealing the renewed bond (Hos 2:1, 25). In these verses the cosmic order reflects the realignment of divine and human orders (cf. Amos 9:1–15). God’s cosmic activity is demonstrated in the concluding oracles of Hosea 2 not only in the enactment of divine justice but also in the unfolding of divine mercy.</p>
      <bh id="bh0303">The Prophet’s Symbolic Act Retold (Hosea 3)</bh>
      <paft>Hosea 3 reiterates the symbolic act of Hosea 1 and echoes the thematic pattern of Hosea 1 and 2. This third formulation of the marriage between God and Israel offers a closer look at the people’s transition to reconciliation.</paft>

        <sl>For the Israelites will remain many days</sl>
        <sl1>without king or prince,</sl1>
        <sl>Without sacrifice or sacred pillar,</sl>
        <sl1>without ephod or household gods.</sl1>
        <sl>Afterward the Israelites will turn back</sl>

        <sl>They will come trembling to the Lord</sl>
        <sl1l>and to his bounty, in the last days. (Hos 3:3–5)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>In this scenario, the wife is to prepare for a long interval during which she will abandon her solicitations of other gods and wait, as her husband waits for her. By analogy, the Israelites remain without fundamental elements of their former life: with no king or prince and without the ritual objects they have misused in their worship of Baal. Divine judgment is assumed rather than announced, as Israel is shown living in a new reality.</p>
      <box>
        <bxh>Ambiguous Religious Rituals</bxh>
        <bxf>The Book of Hosea refers to religious rituals and ritual objects that can be associated with both the worship of Israel’s God and the worship of foreign gods. Raisin cakes were distributed in Israel on major occasions of ritual celebration, for example, the bringing of the ark into Jerusalem (2 Sam 6:19). In Hosea 3:1, however, they serve as <page id="p73"/>emblems of the worship of foreign deities that promise agricultural abundance. Sacred pillars, mentioned in Hosea 3:4 (cf. Hos 10:1–2), are sometimes associated with Israel’s God, as when Jacob sets up a pillar at Bethel to designate that the Lord is there (Gen 28:18). In other biblical texts, however, pillars are regarded as markers of cultic sites where foreign deities are worshipped (Deut 7:5; 12:2–3; Mic 5:12). The ephod, cited in Hosea 3:4, was a priestly garment, part of the prophet Samuel’s ritual dress as he served in the sanctuary at Shiloh (1 Sam 2:18). In some biblical texts the ephod has a pocket containing sacred lots for consulting the will of God, and in 1 Samuel David summons the ephod for that purpose (1 Sam 23:9–12; 30:6–8). The ephod is also used as a vehicle of divination in idolatrous contexts (Judg 8:27; 17:5–6). Household gods, also named in Hosea 3:4, are minor deities invoked for protection within Jacob’s family in Genesis (Gen 31:19, 30–35) but form part of an illegitimate shrine in Judges (Judg 17:5).</bxf>
        <bxl>The practice of lacerating or gashing oneself in supplication for a fruitful harvest is presented as rebellion, literally “turning aside from God” in Hosea 7:14 (cf. the appeal to Baal for rain in 1 Kgs 18:28). At the same time, gashing oneself is associated with mourning for the dead and the worship of God in Jeremiah (Jer 16:6; 41:5).</bxl>
      </box>
      <p>This third narrative indicates that there will be a time in the future when the Israelites turn back and seek both their God and a king in the tradition of David.<fnref idref="fn33">33</fnref> They will draw near to the Lord trembling, aware of the profound changes <page id="p74"/>divine justice has brought to their lives but approaching what they now perceive as God’s abundance (literally, “goodness” or “good things”). The “last days” mark the end of a period of transition for the people of Israel as they engage in a genuine search for God and a new kind of royal leader.</p>
      <p>Hosea 3 affirms the pattern of divine justice followed by divine mercy. Like Hosea 2:4–25, it portrays the experience of deprivation as necessary to Israel’s full reunion with God. In Hosea 3, however, emphasis falls on Israel’s turn to God after enduring a time of desolation in which deceptive objects of trust have vanished but have not yet been replaced.</p>
      <p>The Book of Hosea begins with a threefold metaphorical presentation of the execution of divine justice as part of a pathway toward divine mercy. The oracles of judgment on the Northern Kingdom that follow reveal the complex interplay of divine justice and mercy.</p>
      <ah id="ah0302">The Inherence of Divine Justice and Mercy (Hosea 4:1–3)</ah>

        <sl1l>and even the fish of the sea perish. (Hos 4:1–3)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>These accusations name three qualities absent in the communal life of Israel: fidelity, loyalty, and knowledge of God. These three qualities are grouped with justice and judgment as central to the reunion of God and Israel (Hos 2:21–22). In this oracle they are vital to just relationships: without them false oaths, lying, murder, stealing, adultery, and bloodshed proliferate. Although justice and judgment stand at the head of the qualities with which God betroths Israel in Hosea 2, in this oracle Israel’s lack of faithfulness, loyalty, and knowledge of God has led to injustice in the Northern Kingdom, destroying the community from within.</p>
      <p>In response, the lands itself withers and even the sea cannot support life. The vision of a life-giving chain of response between the heavens and the earth traced at the end of Hosea 2 is replaced by the prospect of a killing drought. Rather than the promise of a divine covenant with all living creatures, the traditional triad of “beasts of the field,” “birds of the air,” and “fish of the sea,” will be gathered up in a universal harvest of death. As in Amos, cosmic disorder is presented as a consequence of human disorder (cf. Amos 4:6–11; 7:1–6; 8:7–9). With this backdrop, the prophetic voice begins to trace the fault lines of the Northern Kingdom.</p>

      <p>Speaking in the first person, God takes priests to task for failing to teach and guide the community in their sacred traditions, that is, in what their relationship with God entails (Lev 10:8–11). Israel’s prophets, too, have failed to assert the validity of these traditions. As a result, God declares that “my people are ruined.”</p>
      <p><page id="p77"/>The priests have not only refused to cultivate the knowledge of God in their people, they have also modeled ungodly behavior:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>The more they multiplied,</slf>
        <sl1>the more they sinned against me…</sl1>

        <sl>Like people, like priest:</sl>

        <sl1l>they prostitute themselves, forsaking their God. (Hos 4:8–12)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>The reference to a multiplication of priests may be related to the spread of local shrines where foreign rituals were introduced. Because priests received a share of sacrifices, they are accused of greed, feeding themselves on what the people offer rather than warning them away from such rituals. The people have followed their priests into prostitution to other gods rather than attending to their own <page id="p78"/>God, indulging in divination and, as if drunk and deluded, seeking advice from wooden cultic objects.</pcon>
      <p>“Like people, like priest.” God vows to confront the people along with the priests and repay them (literally, “turn back their deeds on them”) for their practices. At the same time, the people are portrayed as hapless victims of a “spirit of prostitution” that has overtaken them. Like excessive alcohol, this spirit has overridden their consciousness and will (cf. Hos 4:19; the Hebrew noun <theb>rûaḥ</theb> means both “spirit” and “wind”).</p>
      <p>The oracle ends with God’s statement: “Thus a people without understanding comes to ruin,” literally “will be thrown down” (Hos 4:14). The Hebrew verb translated “to understand” can also mean “to discern.” Along with derived nouns meaning “understanding,” or “discernment,” it is linked in the wisdom tradition with knowledge and instruction.<fnref idref="fn36">36</fnref> Deprived of both, the people will lose their footing and be thrown down, a logical consequence of walking blind.</p>
      <p>At the same time, there is an element of pathos in the way the people have come to this pass, reinforced by God’s declaration, “With you is my dispute, priest!” Fault is found first with those whose task is to instruct. Recognizing Israel’s ignorance does not exonerate those who stubbornly “give themselves to prostitution” (Hos 4:18), but it does evoke some sympathy for them. It also raises the possibility of remedying the lack of knowledge.</p>
      <p>A similar pattern for royal leadership is presented in Hosea 5. Here, the king and his royal house are charged along with the priests.</p>

God thus resolves, literally, to “be discipline for them.”</p>
      <p>The Hebrew noun translated “discipline” and the verb “to discipline” are related to the Hebrew verbal root <theb>ysr</theb>, which means “to discipline, correct” and is, like the verb “to understand,” also associated with learning wisdom. “Discipline” implies “correction” in the sense of training and is often translated in the Book of Proverbs as “instruction.”<fnref idref="fn38">38</fnref> Because Israel’s religious and political leaders have abandoned their roles of teaching and upholding the knowledge of God and of God’s just order, divine instruction is needed.</p>

        <bxh>Assyrian Kingship and Israel</bxh>
        <bxf>Assyrian kings in the time of Hosea referred to themselves with epithets like “the great king” to convey their imperial rule over subject kingdoms and peoples (2 Kgs 18:19, 28). This language is reflected in Hosea: “Ephraim went to Assyria, and sent to the great king” (Hos 5:13; see also <page id="p81"/>10:6). Accusations against Israel for seeking help from the Assyrian king recur elsewhere in Hosea (Hos 7:11; 8:9) and may refer to Israel’s offers to pay tribute to Assyria to avert an invasion (2 Kgs 15:17–20).</bxf>
        <bxl>An initial Assyrian takeover of territory in the Northern Kingdom (2 Kgs 15:29) may lie behind the image of stumbling in Hosea 5:5: “Israel and Ephraim stumble because of their iniquity, and Judah stumbles with them.” The inclusion of Judah in this verse extends the frame of reference to later Assyrian and Babylonian invasions in the Southern Kingdom (cf. Hos 5:14).</bxl>
      </box>
      <p>This misalignment, in which Israel looks to a human emperor and God is inaccessible, makes catastrophe inevitable. God announces this outcome in personal terms:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>For I am like a lion to Ephraim,</slf>
        <sl1>like a young lion to the house of Judah;</sl1>
        <sl>It is I who tear the prey and depart,</sl>
        <sl1l>I carry it away, and no one can save it.<fnref idref="fn39">39</fnref> (Hos 5:14)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>It is Israel’s leaders, however, who have distorted the vision of the people and brought them to the point of dismemberment. Despite the grim prospect of the immediate future, dwelling on the causative aspect of justice, again, introduces the possibility of a remedy.</pcon>
      <p>God’s claim that the king of Assyria cannot cure Ephraim’s sickness and deep wound (Hos 5:13) carries the <page id="p82"/>implication that healing might come about in some other way. Hosea 5 ends by raising the prospect of change:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>I will go back to my place</slf>
        <sl1>until they make reparation</sl1>

        <sll>In their affliction, they shall look for me. 	(Hos 5:15)</sll>
      </senseline>
      <p>This verse seems to contradict the earlier prophetic announcement that “they will go to seek the Lord, but will not find him; he is withdrawn from them” (Hos 5:6), yet it suggests an eventual, rather than an immediate, response from God. The verb translated “make reparation” also means to “bear punishment for guilt” (see Hos 10:2; 14:1; Ps 34:22, 23; Prov 30:10). After enduring the hardships that follow the breakdown of the existing kingdom of Israel (as well as, in time, the kingdom of Judah), the people may come to seek what they have learned is essential to their existence: the presence of God (cf. Hos 2:9). God will withdraw from them until that time: “until” allows for future reconnection (cf. Hos 3:3–5).</p>
      <box>
        <bxh>Human Consequence and Divine Justice</bxh>
        <bxf>Forceful declarations of divine agency in the enactment of justice occur throughout the Book of Hosea: “It is I who tear the prey and depart, I carry it away and no one can save it” (Hos 5:14) or “When they go I will spread my net around them, like birds in the air I will bring them down” (Hos 7:12).</bxf>
        <bx>Other announcements of judgment in Hosea imply a divine role but feature the unfolding of calamity directly from wrongdoing, as poetically depicted in Hosea 8:7: “When they sow the wind, they will reap the whirlwind.” <page id="p83"/>Some passages spell out the dynamic more fully, for example:</bx>
        <senseline>
          <bxslf>Because you have trusted in your own power,</bxslf>
          <bxsl>and in your many warriors,</bxsl>
          <bxsl>The clamor of war shall break out among your people</bxsl>
          <bxsll>and all your fortresses shall be ravaged. (Hos 10:13–14)<fnref idref="fn40">40</fnref></bxsll>
        </senseline>
        <bx>From this viewpoint, the defeat of the kingdom of Israel can be traced directly to its arrogance and perversity: “Israel has rejected what is good; the enemy shall pursue him” (Hos 8:3; cf.5:5; 7:16).</bx>
        <bx>Some passages suggest God’s withdrawal from engagement with Israel, as distinct from direct intervention: “With their flocks and herds they will go to seek the Lord, but will not find him; he has withdrawn from them” (Hos 5:6; cf. Amos 8:11–12) and “I will go back to my place until they make reparation and seek my presence. In their affliction, they shall look for me” (Hos 5:15; cf. 3:5).</bx>
        <bxl>By drawing a direct line between actions and their consequences, Hosea highlights the futility of Israel’s self-driven behavior but does not negate the divine response to it. God declares, “Among the tribes of Israel, I announce what is sure to be” (Hos 5:9). The divine word foretells the devastation toward which Israel is inevitably headed. The Book of Hosea incorporates two interlaced perspectives: the natural consequences of wrongdoing and the divine declaration of judgment.</bxl>

      <ah id="ah0304"><page id="p84"/>The Poignancy of Divine Justice (Hosea 6—10)</ah>
      <paft>Divine speech in Hosea 6—10 includes multiple expressions of God’s regret that the depth of the people’s wrongdoing and the extent of their estrangement from God block divine healing. There is poignancy in the voicing of God’s commitment to care for Israel in the face of inevitable judgment.</paft>
      <p>Hosea 6 begins with a voicing of the community’s resolve to turn to God for healing.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Come, let us return to the Lord,</slf>
        <sl1>for it is he who has torn, but he will heal us;</sl1>

        <sl>He will revive us after two days;</sl>
        <sl1>on the third day he will raise us up,</sl1>
        <sl1>to live in his presence.</sl1>
        <sl>Let us know, let us strive to know the Lord,</sl>
        <sl1>as certain as the dawn is his coming.</sl1>
        <sl>He will come to us like the rain,</sl>
        <sl1l>like spring rain that waters the earth. (Hos 6:1–3)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>In these verses, the people note that they have suffered harm at God’s hand yet are confident that God will mend their injuries. They trust that after an interval God will raise them up to live again in divine favor,<fnref idref="fn41">41</fnref> and they urge each other to acknowledge their relationship with the Lord as the one they can count on.</pcon>
      <p><page id="p85"/>What is missing in this appeal is any shading of certainty in a favorable response. The community seems to presume divine healing is theirs when they ask for it. Their association of the Lord with rain that waters the earth is ironic in view of the people’s devotion to the rain god Baal. It also suggests they may be approaching God as they do Baal, in hopes of a swift response rather than of a long-term relationship of commitment.</p>
      <p>God’s response to the people reveals a divine dilemma.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>What can I do with you, Ephraim?</slf>
        <sl1>What can I do with you, Judah?</sl1>
        <sl>Your loyalty is like morning mist,</sl>
        <sl1>like the dew that disappears early.</sl1>
        <sl>For this reason I struck them down through the 	prophets,</sl>
        <sl1>I killed them by the words of my mouth;</sl1>
        <sl1>my judgment shines forth like the light.</sl1>
        <sl>For it is loyalty that I desire, not sacrifice,</sl>
        <sl1l>and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. (Hos 6:4–6)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>Without “loyalty” (<theb>ḥesed</theb>), a commitment on the part of the people, their words carry no weight but evaporate like the most insubstantial of natural phenomena: mist and dew. Like light, divine judgment exposes the flimsiness of the people’s underlying acknowledgment of God.</pcon>
      <p>God’s repeated question “What can I do with you?,” however, suggests deliberation in the exercise of judgment. Addressing the people directly as “you” and calling them by the personal name Ephraim, the divine voice conveys regret that the people do not know how to speak to their God. Posing the same question to Judah heightens its poignancy.</p>
      <p><page id="p86"/>A sense of lost possibility and regret comes through in a subsequent divine speech:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>When I would have restored the fortunes of my 	people,</slf>
        <sl1>when I would have healed Israel,</sl1>
        <sl>The guilt of Ephraim was revealed,</sl>
        <sl1>the wickedness of Samaria:</sl1>
        <sl>They practiced falsehood.</sl>
        <sl1>Thieves break in,</sl1>
        <sl1>bandits roam outside.</sl1>
        <sl>Yet they do not call to mind</sl>
        <sl1>that I remember all their wickedness.</sl1>
        <sl>Now their crimes surround them,</sl>
        <sl1l>present to my sight. (Hos 6:11b—7:2)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>God’s efforts to restore and heal have only revealed the depths of Israel’s degeneration: deceitful and aggressive acts take multiple forms in Ephraim and its capital city, Samaria. Such practices have become the norm, carried out without even a nod to God’s all-seeing presence.</pcon>
      <p>Israel’s failure to grasp the impact of its behavior and to take account of God’s oversight is depicted in the following divine assessment:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Ephraim is like a dove,</slf>
        <sl1>silly and senseless;</sl1>
        <sl>They call upon Egypt,</sl>
        <sl1>they go to Assyria.</sl1>
        <sl>When they go I will spread my net around them,</sl>
        <sl1>like birds in the air I will bring them down.</sl1>
        <sl1l>I will chastise them when I hear of their assembly. (Hos 7:11–12)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p><page id="p87"/>The laughable image of a pigeon turning its neck this way and that to find crumbs matches the behavior of Israel attempting to bargain with the massive empires of Assyria and Egypt. That in the end the Israelites will unwittingly be trapped in a net like a bird without sense is pitiable, even if this outcome is just. The divine declaration “I will chastise them” conveys more than simple judgment. The Hebrew verb translated “chastise” also stems from the Hebrew root <theb>ysr</theb>, which means “to discipline” in the sense of instruction and correction (cf. Hos 5:2; 7:15; 10:10).</p>
      <p>The next verses reveal the Israelites’ hostile response to divine attempts to “train” and “strengthen” them as a people.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Though I wished to redeem them,</slf>
        <sl1>they spoke lies against me.</sl1>
        <sl>They have not cried to me from their hearts</sl>
        <sl1>when they wailed upon their beds;</sl1>
        <sl>For wheat and wine they lacerated themselves;</sl>
        <sl1>they rebelled against me.</sl1>
        <sl>Though I trained and strengthened their arms,</sl>
        <sl1l>yet they devised evil against me. (Hos 7:13–15)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>God’s intent was to rescue the Israelites from self-destruction. The people, however, turned not only away from, but against, God. They have spoken “lies against me,” “perhaps a reference to the denial of divine sovereignty implicit both in the people’s appeals to Baal and their entreaties to Assyria and Egypt (Hos 12:1–2; cf. Amos 2:4).</p>
      <p>The divine voice probes further: the people have not cried out to God “from their hearts,” that is, with full commitment. They have continued to engage in Baalistic rituals, wailing and lacerating their skin for what they want: wheat and wine, emblems of agricultural fertility (cf. 1 Kgs 18:28). <page id="p88"/>In doing so they have defied the care God has given to training, or instructing, them as a people and have set themselves against divine purposes: “they devised evil against me.”</p>
      <p>There is poignancy in these portrayals of God’s hopes for Israel gone awry. It is not surprising that God laments, “How long will they be incapable of innocence?” (Hos 8:5) and “Though I write for him my many instructions, they are considered like a stranger’s” (Hos 8:12).</p>
      <p>The additional comparison of Ephraim to a heifer offers a parable-like image of God’s attempts to train and guide Israel.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Ephraim was a trained heifer,</slf>
        <sl1>that loved to thresh;</sl1>
        <sl>I myself laid a yoke</sl>
        <sl1>upon her beautiful neck;</sl1>
        <sl>I will make Ephraim break ground,</sl>
        <sl1>Judah must plow,</sl1>
        <sl1>Jacob must harrow for himself:</sl1>
        <sl>“Sow for yourselves justice,</sl>
        <sl1>reap the reward of loyalty;</sl1>
        <sl>Break up for yourselves a new field,</sl>
        <sl1>for it is time to seek the Lord,</sl1>
        <sl1l>till he comes and rains justice upon you.” (Hos 10:11–12)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>Following the metaphor, Ephraim was once trained (literally, “taught”) by God to thresh grain, accepted God’s yoke, and willingly carried out the work of the harvest. Now God will compel Ephraim to break ground in a new, unplowed field. Metaphor yields to instruction as God addresses the people directly. They must do the work of sowing justice, or righteousness (<theb>ṣědāqâ</theb>) in their communal life. Only then <page id="p89"/>can they reap the yield of their loyal commitment (<theb>ḥesed</theb>), which is God’s loyalty or mercy (<theb>ḥesed</theb>) toward them. The command to “break up for yourselves a new field” is related to the command to seek the Lord. A sustained effort to live out these commands over time is implied, during which the people wait for a divine rain of justice or righteousness (<theb>ṣedeq</theb>) that will bring what they sow to fruition. The divine voice indicates a period of growth for the Israelites rather than an immediate shower of blessings (cf. Hos 3:3).</pcon>
      <p>God’s directive to Israel implies the possibility of a willing response. At the same time, God recognizes the reverse in the nation’s immediate reality.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>But you have plowed wickedness, reaped 	perversity,</slf>

      <ah id="ah0305"><page id="p90"/>Parent and Child: Divine Justice and Mercy in Counterpoint (Hosea 11)</ah>
      <paft>The metaphor of Israel as child and God as parent in Hosea 11 corresponds like a second weight-bearing pillar to the opening metaphor of Israel as wife and God as husband. As Hosea 1—3 draws on the language of marriage, Hosea 11 brings that of parenthood to bear on the interplay of justice and mercy in God’s relationship with Israel. Whereas the opening chapters of the book trace a movement through divine justice to divine mercy, Hosea 11 introduces these two themes in counterpoint, as if distinct melodic lines that interweave.</paft>
      <p>Hosea 11 begins with the memory of God’s care for Israel from the beginning.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>When Israel was a child I loved him,</slf>
        <sl1>out of Egypt I called my son.</sl1>

        <sl1>the farther they went from me,</sl1>
        <sl>Sacrificing to the Baals</sl>
        <sl1>and burning incense to idols.</sl1>
        <sl>Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk,</sl>
        <sl1>who took them in my arms,</sl1>
        <sl1>but they did not know that I cared for them.</sl1>
        <sl>I drew them with human cords,</sl>
        <sl1>with bands of love;</sl1>
        <sl>I fostered them like those who raise an infant to 	their cheeks;</sl>
        <sl1l>I bent down to feed them. (Hos 11:1–4)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>God’s patience with Israel as a child demonstrates the active dimensions of the verb “to love.” God brought <page id="p91"/>this people into being out of Egypt and continued to guide them, even though they, in a contrary movement, retreated toward the Baals.<fnref idref="fn43">43</fnref> God, however, still holds in memory the child Ephraim. The phrase “taught Ephraim to walk” reads, literally, “guided their feet,” creating the image of a parent physically supporting and steering a young child in its first steps. God cared for them (literally, “healed them”) through their missteps and tumbles, bending down as if to an infant that cries out to be held and fed.</p>
      <p>As a young child, Ephraim did not realize the extent of God’s patient nurturing. Full-grown now, Ephraim has still not acknowledged his life-giving connection with God but has repeatedly sought out other sources of well-being. An awakening is due.</p>

      </senseline>
      <p>The word play in these verses is deft: because Israel has refused to repent, or turn, to the Lord, the people will symbolically return to Egypt, the site of their enslavement, by becoming captives of the Assyrian king. The people have set their own course in turning away from God. They are literally “attached” to their apostasy, rather than pulled by the <page id="p92"/>“human cords” and “bands of love” with which God drew them (Hos 11:4). Even though they call out in distress, God can no longer simply lift them up in their need.</p>
      <p>Despite the tight case for divine justice, a contrasting note of divine love and compassion breaks in:</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>How could I give you up, Ephraim,</slf>
        <sl1>or deliver you up, Israel?</sl1>
        <sl>How could I treat you as Admah,</sl>
        <sl1>or make you like Zeboiim?<fnref idref="fn44">44</fnref></sl1>
        <sl>My heart is overwhelmed,</sl>
        <sl1>my pity is stirred.</sl1>
        <sl>I will not give vent to my blazing anger,</sl>
        <sl1>I will not destroy Ephraim again;</sl1>
        <sl>For I am God and not a man,</sl>
        <sl1>the Holy One present among you;</sl1>
        <sl1l>I will not come in wrath. (Hos 11:8–9)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The opening questions convey, again, God’s engagement with what happens to Ephraim (cf. Hos 6:4). The logic of justice gives way here to a strong expression of pity for Ephraim: God’s heart literally “turns over,” in a countermovement. Divine pity stirs (literally, “grows warm”), subduing the burning anger that represents God’s determination to enact judgment (cf. Amos 7:3, 6).<fnref idref="fn45">45</fnref> God knows that Ephraim has “practiced prostitution,” “willingly gone after filth,” and “sunk to the depths of corruption” (Hos 5:3; 11; 9:9). Yet God can also see in Ephraim the loved child.</p>
      <p>As divine mercy sounds the dominant note, God makes clear that the divine is not human. God is the Holy One in the midst of human life. The Hebrew word translated “holy” <page id="p93"/>means “to be set apart” or distinct from what is limited and temporary. The Holy One exists in a reality that transcends the human, though remaining connected to it. God does not act solely out of justified anger but sees beyond the time of reckoning.<fnref idref="fn46">46</fnref></p>
      <p>The resurgence of divine pity and mercy does not deny the enactment of justice. It does indicate, however, that God’s refusal to rescue Ephraim at this moment of crisis does not spell the end of divine care for Israel. The concluding verses of Hosea 11 suggest an aftermath.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>They shall follow the Lord,</slf>
        <sl1>who roars like a lion;</sl1>
        <sl>When he roars,</sl>
        <sl1>his children shall come frightened from the west,</sl1>
        <sl>Out of Egypt they shall come trembling, like 	birds,</sl>
        <sl1>like doves, from the land of Assyria;</sl1>
        <sl>And I will resettle them in their homes,</sl>
        <sl1l>oracle of the Lord. (Hos 11:10–11)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>At a later time, God’s people will respond to the Lord. Cognizant of divine power, they will draw near when they hear the divine roar, though frightened and trembling from all they have experienced (cf. Hos 3:5). In moving away from the imperial powers they once looked to for protection, they are no longer senseless doves (Hos 7:11) but birds who know a homing call when they hear it.</pcon>
      <p>God’s vow not to destroy Ephraim “again” (Hos 11:9) suggests a sequence that begins with divine justice. The vision of a return from Egypt and Assyria implies an experience of widespread displacement, such as occurred after the <page id="p94"/>conquest of the Northern Kingdom and, later, of Judah. At the same time, the question “How could I give you up, Ephraim, or deliver you up, Israel?” signals that the divine heart encompasses both justice and mercy, giving voice to the reality of each.</p>
      <ah id="ah0306">The Contrapuntal Movement of Divine Justice and Mercy (Hosea 12:1—14:9)</ah>
      <paft>The metaphor of parent and child in Hosea 11 grows naturally out of God’s desire to heal and guide the people of Israel conveyed in Hosea 6—10. In turn, Hosea 11 serves as an introduction to the extended personification of Israel as Ephraim in Hosea 12—14. Read together, Hosea 11—14 display a contrapuntal movement of divine justice and mercy throughout the history of the people of Israel with the God who has been theirs “since the land of Egypt” (Hos 12:10; 13:4; cf. 9:10–11).</paft>
      <p>In these chapters, Ephraim’s lineage is traced to Jacob, ancestor of the twelve tribes of Israel. In the Book of Genesis, God appears to Jacob at Bethel, promises him the land and descendants to live in it, and names him Israel (Gen 28:10–22; Gen 32:23–33; Gen 35:9–15).<fnref idref="fn47">47</fnref> In Hosea, as in Amos, Jacob is particularly associated with the Northern Kingdom. Despite his role as a storied ancestor, he is subject to divine critique.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>The Lord has a dispute with Judah,</slf>
        <sl1>and will punish Jacob for his conduct,</sl1>
        <sl1>and repay him for his deeds.</sl1>
        <sl><page id="p95"/>In the womb he supplanted his brother,</sl>
        <sl1>And in his vigor he contended with a divine being;</sl1>
        <sl>He contended with an angel and prevailed,</sl>
        <sl1>He wept and entreated him.</sl1>
        <sl>At Bethel he met with him,</sl>
        <sl1>And there he spoke with him.</sl1>
        <sl>The Lord is the God of hosts,</sl>
        <sl1>The Lord is his name!</sl1>
        <sl>You must return to your God.</sl>
        <sl1>Maintain loyalty and justice</sl1>
        <sl1l>and always hope in your God. (Hos 12:3–7)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>This announcement of a divine reckoning is addressed to Jacob’s descendants in both Northern and Southern Kingdoms: God will, literally, “return” on them their wrongful acts. In addition, God offers an instruction that bears ongoing significance for future generations: they must “return” to the God of heavenly hosts whom Jacob encountered at Bethel (cf. Amos 4:12–13; 5:14–15; 9:5–6). It is this God who now reveals a path through and beyond the looming collapse of the Northern Kingdom and later conquest of the Southern Kingdom. The people of Israel are to guard the fundamental elements of their relationship with God—loyalty (<theb>ḥesed</theb>) and justice (<theb>mis̆pāṭ</theb>). Furthermore, they are to hope in God’s divine power to sustain them and bring them home in time, as Jacob once returned from his own exile.</p>
      <p>The following verses resume the accusation of Israel personified as Ephraim, the grandson of Jacob.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>A merchant who holds a false balance,</slf>

        <sl1><page id="p96"/>I have made a fortune!”</sl1>
        <sl>All his gain will not suffice</sl>
        <sl1>for the guilt of his sin.</sl1>
        <sl>I, the Lord, have been your God,</sl>

        <sl>I will again have you live in tents,</sl>
        <sl1l>as on feast days. (Hos 12:8–10)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>To address Ephraim as a merchant (<theb>kěnaʿan</theb>) is to associate him with the Canaanites, who were famed traders across the ancient Mediterranean as well as supplicants of Baal. Here, Ephraim’s focus on prosperity includes falsifying scales to create higher profits and seeking riches by any means (cf. Hos 10:4; Amos 8:4–6). In this context God’s declaration, “I the Lord have been your God, since the land of Egypt” (Hos 12:10) serves more as a recrimination than as an assurance of commitment (cf. Amos 3:1–2). An announcement of judgment follows: “I will again have [the people of Israel] live in tents.” The feast days during which the Israelites ritually reenacted their journey through the wilderness have not kept them mindful of their life as a people led by God. They will relive that memory when they are ejected from their homes in the land. Ephraim here has aroused “bitter anger” in God rather than pity (Hos 12:15; cf. 11:9).</p>
      <p>A stern tone of judgment resumes in Hosea 13 as God declares, “Compassion is hidden from my eyes” (Hos 13:14), in counterpoint to the earlier divine disclosure that “my pity is stirred” (Hos 11:8). Clearly divine justice does not fade with the God’s expression of compassion for Ephraim but plays out with equal urgency.</p>
      <p>The tone of dread and horror carries over to the opening verse of the last chapter of Hosea.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf><page id="p97"/>Samaria has become guilty,</slf>

      </senseline>
      <pcon>Samaria, the royal capital of the Northern Kingdom, will suffer the barbarities of military conquest.</pcon>
      <p>In the next verse, however, the hope of divine mercy recurs.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Return, Israel, to the Lord, your God;</slf>
        <sl1>You have stumbled because of your iniquity.</sl1>

        <sl>Say to him, “Forgive all iniquity,</sl>
        <sl1>and take what is good.</sl1>
        <sl1>Let us offer the fruit of our lips.<fnref idref="fn49">49</fnref></sl1>
        <sl>Assyria will not save us,</sl>

        <sl1>to the work of our hands;</sl1>
        <sl1l>for in you the orphan finds compassion.” (Hos 14:2–4)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>Here the prophetic voice provides words for the people to bring to God after they have stumbled and fallen. In <page id="p98"/>contrast to their earlier voicing of confidence in divine healing (Hos 6:1–6), this appeal begins with a plea for forgiveness, an acknowledgment of wrongdoing, and a commitment to manifest change. The phrase “the fruit of our lips” expresses a genuine pledge of action. The Israelites will renounce the imperial power of Assyria, the strength of armies equipped with horses, and the humanly constructed gods represented by idols. None of these can ensure Israel’s well-being. Rather, the people are to turn to the God who acts out of compassion for those who are bereft and helpless.</p>
      <p>The words supplied by the prophetic speaker imply trust that the people of Israel are capable of learning how to restore their relationship with God (cf. Hos 10:12; 12:7). If they reject their delusions, implore God to look on their potential for good, and pledge themselves to live out what they say, the divine voice affirms, transformation is possible.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>I will heal their apostasy,</slf>

        <sl>His splendor will be like the olive tree,</sl>

        <sl>Again they will live in his shade;</sl>
        <sl1>they will raise grain,</sl1>
        <sl>They will blossom like the vine,</sl>
        <sl1>and his renown will be like the wine of Lebanon.</sl1>
        <sl>Ephraim! What more have I to do with idols?</sl>
        <sl1>I have humbled him, but I will take note of him.</sl1>

        <sl1l>From me fruit will be found for you. (Hos 14:5–9)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <pcon>Divine love will heal Israel from their “apostasy” (literally, “turning back” from God), turning divine anger away from them (cf. Hos 11:8–9). God’s promise to love “freely” implies unstinting good will and care.</pcon>
      <p>The mending of ties between God and Israel leads to human flourishing, represented by images of natural growth that are both intimate and broad in scope (cf. Amos 9:13–15). God will be like dew that touches and revives the people and like shade that covers and relieves them. The blessings of divine presence will enable them to strike roots that send out new shoots, spreading far and wide. Splendid to the eyes as an olive tree laden with fruit and fragrant as a full-grown cedar, Israel will stand out unforgettably to all.</p>
      <p>In this new reality, neither God nor Ephraim will give a thought to idols (Hos 2:18–19). Rather, God’s full gaze will be on Ephraim because Ephraim now looks only to God. As the Israelites offer the fruit of their lips, they will experience a new fruitfulness flowing from the God who has brought them to trust in divine care. Like a cypress tree, green in all seasons, God will stand in their midst as a source of abundance.</p>
      <p>Hosea 12—14 draws to a conclusion, as does Hosea 11, with a sublime vision of divine mercy (cf. Hos 1—3). This vision does not displace the grave reality of judgment but holds a place alongside it.</p>
      <ah id="ah0307">Epilogue: The Wisdom of Divine Justice and Mercy (Hosea 14:10)</ah>
      <p>In Hosea 4—14, the people of Israel are shown to be without understanding and knowledge of God. God cannot <page id="p100"/>reach them, and they cannot reach God. This impasse is due in good part to the failures of Israel’s leaders. At the same time, the prophetic voice implies at intervals that the people can be taught how to acknowledge their relationship with God (Hos 10:12; 12:6–7; 14:2–4). The book’s epilogue brings the language of biblical wisdom instruction to bear on the oracles that have preceded.</p>
      <senseline>
        <slf>Who is wise enough to understand these things?</slf>
        <sl1>Who is intelligent enough to know them?</sl1>
        <sl>Straight are the paths of the Lord,</sl>
        <sl1>the just walk in them,</sl1>
        <sl1l>but sinners stumble in them. (Hos 14:10)</sl1l>
      </senseline>
      <p>The opening questions of this final verse prompt the prophetic audience to weigh the oracles of Hosea from the standpoint of the wisdom tradition. These questions pose two challenges that suggest wisdom and discernment are needed to absorb the significance of the oracles that have been heard. They also, paradoxically, point to the limits of human wisdom and the role of divine guidance in human understanding.</p>
      <p>The instruction with which the verse ends reflects the wisdom of the Book of Proverbs, which encourages individuals to plot out the consequences of the decisions they make and to act deliberately. Proverbs 14:15 is representative: “The naive believe everything, but the shrewd watch their steps.” The last verse of Hosea asks audiences to do this in light of what they have heard about Israel’s past and present choices and God’s responses to them. It infers that there are teaching moments in human life, whether experienced directly or vicariously, through which communities can grow in discernment. Contemplating these moments <page id="p101"/>heightens the capacity to distinguish between ultimately futile modes of acting and those that yield lasting benefits.</p>
      <box>
        <bxh>Proverbial Wisdom in Hosea</bxh>
        <bxf>A fundamental aspect of wisdom in Proverbs is learning to perceive what is just as wise and what is wicked as foolish. The upright path is wise because it runs straight ahead to completion, whereas the devious path is foolish because it brings trouble and grief (Prov 4:10–19). By pondering multiple variations on this theme, the spectrum of sayings and instructions in Proverbs offers a means for the young to grow in wisdom and for those who have already gained some wisdom to advance further in it (Prov 1:1–7).</bxf>
        <bxl>In Proverbs, it is the wise teacher, often the parent, who teaches and trains the young in wise behavior (see Proverbs 1–9). In the Book of Hosea, the divine voice reveals the bones and sinews of wisdom. God promises to divert the Israelites away from their foolish pursuits, transforming them through their experience of divine justice and mercy and spelling out what they need to say and do to approach their divine sustainer (10:12; 12:7; 14:3–5). God’s intent is to bring the people and their leaders to realize their inherent limits and need of divine guidance, both of which are essential to mending the divine-human relationship (Hos 2:9; 5:15; 7:14; 14:5).</bxl>
      </box>
      <p>The oracles of judgment in Hosea depict an abandonment of trust in God that has led to the unravelling of the Northern Kingdom. Expressions of divine mercy in the book hold out the alternative of living in connection with God under divine direction. The instruction of Hosea 14:10 echoes the substance of Proverbs 10:29: “The Lord is a <page id="p102"/>stronghold to those who walk honestly, downfall for evildoers” (cf. Prov 4:11–12).</p>
      <p>The wisdom tradition acknowledges the concept of limits to human understanding, however, as in Proverbs 16:9, “The human heart plans the way, but the Lord directs the steps” and Proverbs 20:24, “Our steps are from the Lord; how, then, can mortals understand their way?” The opening questions of Hosea 14:10 suggest that no human being is wise or intelligent enough to comprehend all the ins and outs of human and divine interaction. Rather, audiences are encouraged to choose the paths that God has established. What is crucial to keep in mind is that the just move straight ahead on these paths while those who second-guess God’s ways stumble and fall: divine justice is always at work. The presupposition that some in Israel can be called “just” implies trust in the potential of human beings to learn discernment and choose wisely. In this trust, divine mercy is also at play.</p>
      <ah id="ah0308">The Interface of Divine Justice and Mercy in Hosea</ah>
      <paft>Hosea portrays a personal relationship between God and Israel in which divine justice and mercy interweave. God’s connection with Israel is like that of spouse to spouse or parent to child, and the divine decision to uphold justice is accompanied by expressions of God’s desire to heal and redeem a people who are courting tragedy. As in Amos, divine justice interfaces with mercy in Hosea, but the pattern of this interface differs in the two books. The oracles of Amos draw out the merciful dimensions of God’s justice, while divine justice and mercy are juxtaposed throughout the Book of Hosea.</paft>
      <p><page id="p103"/>Hosea opens with three scenarios of divine condemnation, each of which concludes with proclamations of divine mercy. As a sequel to naming Israel “Not-Pitied” and “Not-My-People,” God renames the Israelites “Pitied” and reclaims them as “My People” (Hos 2:3). A new betrothal between God and people will join them in loyalty, compassion, and faithfulness as well as in justice and righteousness, all qualities essential to knowing God (Hos 2:21–22). Furthermore, God promises to wait for the people to turn back toward “the Lord, their God,” allowing them time to reorient themselves and trusting that they will (Hos 3:3–5).</p>
      <p>The body of the book begins with an overarching oracle of judgment on Israel in which the people’s lack of faithfulness, loyalty, and knowledge of God underlies pervasive social degeneration (Hos 4:1–2). The offenses named and the blood shed in the Northern Kingdom show ruthless disregard for the lives of members of the same community. Such injustices will be answered by a fundamental disruption of the cosmic order on which all living things depend. (Hos 4:3).</p>
      <p>Evocations of divine compassion are yoked with divine justice in the oracles that follow, however. God holds the religious leaders of Israel responsible for allowing the people to fall captive to a “spirit of prostitution” to foreign gods from which they cannot break free (Hos 4:4–14). Pursuing illusory sources of prosperity and security under corrupt royal leadership, the nation has suffered but does not know how to approach God for divine help, assuming it is theirs on demand (Hos 6:1–6). God expresses longing to heal Ephraim, but the nation is unable to change course, despite the blows that have weakened it (Hos 5:4–6; 7:9–10). Ephraim is depicted as naïve and pitiable in his attempts to find safety in the aggressive empires of Egypt and Assyria while failing to cry out to God from the heart (Hos 7:11–14).</p>
      <p><page id="p104"/>For a time, Ephraim was taught by God and willing to accept the divine yoke but in the end threw it off and produced only perversity (Hos 7:15; 10:11–13). Despite this, God attempts to guide the Israelites: “Sow for yourselves justice, reap the reward of loyalty” (Hos 10:12) and “Maintain loyalty and justice and always hope in your God” (Hos 12:7).</p>
      <p>Divine expressions of regret and loss in these oracles hint at the interface of justice and mercy in God’s response to Israel. Beginning in Hosea 11 these two qualities play out side by side as if in musical counterpoint. God recalls a love for Israel like that of parent for child. Because the nation’s attention is on other, dubious sources of well-being, God cannot lift them above certain catastrophe (Hos 11:1–7). Divine pity, however, prevents God from destroying Ephraim definitively. God is divine, not human, distinct from the people of Israel, though present among them. Beyond the present rupture, God continues to embrace the Israelites as children, calling them home from exile in Egypt and Assyria and resettling them in their own homes (Hos 11:8–11).</p>
      <p>God’s determination to bring Ephraim to account is strongly reasserted in the prophetic speeches of the last chapters of the book (Hos 12:1—14:1), however. The descendants of Jacob will again live in tents, as wanderers and nomads (Hos 12:10). God will move to enact justice: “Compassion is hidden from my eyes” (Hos 13:14). Samaria will suffer the brutal realities of warfare and defeat (Hos 14:1).</p>
      <p>The proclamation of divine justice still resonates as divine mercy sounds the final note in Hosea 14. Mercy is implied in the way the prophetic voice provides words with which the people can approach God, the one in whom “the orphan finds compassion” (Hos 14:2–4). Mercy is manifest in God’s promise to heal the people and love them freely <page id="p105"/>(Hos 14:5). Images of divine presence suffusing the land like dew and shade relay the merciful aspect of God’s trust that the people of Israel can ultimately take the words given them to heart and acknowledge God as the one who shelters and nourishes them (Hos 14:6–9).</p>
      <p>The last verse of Hosea suggests that the full interplay of divine justice and mercy is ultimately beyond human wisdom (Hos 14:10). What can be grasped is wisdom enough to go on with: the paths of the Lord run straight ahead for the just, but those who attempt to breach the boundaries of those paths will not travel far. There is both mercy and justice in Hosea’s parting word. Divine mercy offers the possibility of human flourishing, divine justice reveals the consequences of dismissing this opportunity. The three-part prologue to Hosea implies, however, that one outcome of suffering such consequences is coming to know the depth and breadth of God’s mercy. Divine justice and mercy are presented as inseparable, though distinct, in Hosea, and both are seen as stemming from the familial bond between God and the people of Israel.</p>

      <ct>Confluence and Divergence in Amos and Hosea</ct>
      <pf>The Books of Amos and Hosea convey divine perspectives on the fall of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Each draws on traditions of God’s relationship with Israel, and each reveals a breakdown in that relationship. This rupture is manifest in the practices and perspectives of the Israelite community, especially of those who lead and shape the nation. Both prophetic books affirm the enactment of divine justice as essential to bringing Israel back within the orbit of divine mercy.</pf>
      <p>At first glance, the thrust and tone of the two books seem very different. The prophetic oracles of Amos focus on divine judgment of the “sinful kingdom” of Israel for its indifference to the disadvantaged and its arrogance in thinking it can escape disaster (Amos 9:10). Amos’s speeches are directed toward a complacent crowd that is undisturbed by habitual injustices in their midst and oblivious to any kind of reckoning. The prophetic warnings of this book evoke an elemental fear of the cosmic oversight of God, whose protective care of the Israelites when they were weak and helpless calls for far more from them than they have been willing to give.</p>
      <p><page id="p107"/>Hosea foregrounds an inherent link between divine justice and mercy in God’s response to the Israelites’ failures. The book repeatedly draws attention both to the care God has shown Israel over time and to divine regret and pity for the corruption and folly of the Northern Kingdom’s people and leaders. Hosea’s oracles warn of the brutal consequences of Israel’s failings yet introduce the possibility that the people may come to trust in God’s mercy beyond the precarious present and take initial steps toward the divine presence.</p>
      <p>Close readings of Amos and Hosea reveal multiple aspects of justice and mercy in each book. Divine judgment on Israel in Amos, severe and ironclad as it seems, is founded on compassion for those in distress (Amos 2:6–8). Furthermore, the announcement of judgment in Amos spells out the relational dynamic of justice in a nation that inflicts harm on its own people yet owes its existence to divine protection (Amos 2:9–10). A range of natural and human catastrophes are viewed as signals intended to awaken the Israelites to God’s activity in the cosmos and prompting them to reorient themselves to it (Amos 4:6–13). The first two of the four prophetic visions in Amos 7:1—8:2 display God’s patience with Israel’s inability to interpret such signals. Divine instructions to Israel in Amos 5 raise the possibility of divine favor for those who seek God and the good after the coming disaster (Amos 5:4–6, 14–15). God’s careful calibration of judgment after the nation’s downfall is captured in the image of a sieve sifting the house of Israel (Amos 9:9–10). Those who accept the reality of divine justice, unlike those who claim immunity, will be resown in a land flourishing with well-being and secure in its future (Amos 9:14–15).</p>
      <p>Conversely, Hosea’s assertion of divine mercy toward Israel does not diminish the force of divine judgment. In the <page id="p108"/>metaphorical narratives of the marriage of God and Israel (Hos 1—3), judgment is presented as a withdrawal of divine blessings and a necessary phase through which Israel, as wife, will acknowledge God as the one who loves her. The oracle that opens the body of prophetic speeches in Hosea envisions a drought that will obliterate all living things in response to rampant injustices that set neighbor against neighbor (Hos 4:1–3). Evocations of pity for a people denied the knowledge of God by its spiritual leaders and the enactment of justice by their kings reflect the suffering Israel will inevitably undergo (Hos 6—10). God’s refusal to rescue Ephraim from disaster, even when the people cry out for help, is softened but not erased by the divine promise “I will not destroy Ephraim again” (Hos 11:9). This pledge of future mercy is followed in Hosea 12—13 by more denunciations of Ephraim’s “lies and violence” (Hos 12:2). As a nation, Ephraim has elicited “bitter anger” from God (Hos 12:15) as well as pity, leading the divine voice to declare flatly, “Compassion is hidden from my eyes” (Hos 13:14). Judgment ultimately yields to divine mercy in the final chapter of Hosea: “I have humbled him, but I will take note of him” (Hos 14:9). At the same time, the book ends with a caution: the just walk the straight paths of the Lord, but sinners (rebels) stumble in them (Hos 14:10). Divine protection is linked to the practice of justice, and those who defy God’s ways will lose their footing. Stumbling remains a possibility (cf. Hos 4:5; 5:5).</p>
      <p>Despite points of thematic convergence, Amos and Hosea explore the interplay of divine justice and mercy in distinctive ways. The Book of Amos draws primary attention to dimensions of justice that are rooted in universal parameters of the divine creative order. Dimensions of mercy in Amos’s oracles of judgment affirm that divine justice is not vindictive but rather founded in God’s compassion for the <page id="p109"/>weak and enacted with patience and discernment. The Book of Hosea repeatedly yokes justice and mercy within the portrayal of a personal relationship between God and Israel, as intimate as that between spouse and spouse or between parent and child. Key passages throughout Hosea underscore that divine mercy is not only part of the enactment of divine judgment but follows it. Both books close with the prospect of a new harmony between God and Israel, but the transition to this ultimate outpouring of divine mercy is given greater attention in Hosea.</p>
      <p>How, then, do these two articulations of the dynamic of divine justice and mercy interface? In some ways, the books form a prophetic witness in counterpoint, creating a complex harmony between divine justice and mercy replete with moments of both confluence and divergence.</p>
      <ah id="ah0401">Broad Lines of Confluence</ah>
      <paft>Broadly speaking, the perspectives of Amos and Hosea intersect in their grounding of divine justice in God’s compassionate mercy. In Amos, divine deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and care for them in their earliest days is a sign of God’s compassion toward all who are weak and helpless (Amos 2:9–10; 3:1–2). As overseer of the divine order, God protects the boundaries that prevent the strong from preying on the weak (Amos 5:7–15). The human practice of justice in Amos entails respect for those boundaries as well as for the God who guards them.</paft>
      <p>Hosea portrays an intimate bond in the land between God and the Israelites. God has showered this people with the gifts of agricultural produce they need for life. Such divine generosity calls for an answering generosity and commitment on the people’s part toward all members of <page id="p110"/>their community (Hos 4:1–2; 6:6; 7:1–2; 12:7). The human practice of justice in Hosea is an acknowledgment of the Israelites’ dependence on divine mercy and an expression of trust in the God who has pity on Ephraim (Hos 11:8), as well as on all who are bereft and powerless (Hos 14:4).</p>
      <p>The importance of reverence for God’s cosmic movements in Amos (Amos 4:13; 5:8–9; 8:8–9; 9:5–6) is consonant with Hosea’s emphasis on the need to acknowledge God as the sole creator of abundance in the land (Hos 2:10, 23–24; 11:4; 14:5–9). The divine roar that opens the Book of Amos and the specter of a cosmic drought at the beginning of Hosea mean what they portend: the people of the Northern Kingdom will suffer the consequences of perpetuating human injustice in their midst (Amos 1:2; Hos 4:1–3).</p>
      <p>Both Amos and Hosea reveal signs of divine patience and pity in God’s judgment on Israel. Although the destruction of the Northern Kingdom and the dispersal of its people cannot be turned back, divine instructions point a way forward after disaster (Amos 5:4, 14; Hos 10:12; 12:7; 14:2–4). So, too, do divine promises to bring to life a new people, planted in the land by the God who is both gardener and garden (Amos 9:11–15; Hos 2:23–25; 11:10–11; 14:5–9).</p>
      <ah id="ah0402">Confluence and Divergence</ah>
      <bhaft id="bhaft0401">Worship</bhaft>
      <paft>Within these broad lines of harmony are many particular points of confluence and divergence. One such point is critique of the worship of God in Israel. Oracles in both Amos and Hosea announce the coming destruction of sanctuaries in the Northern Kingdom (Amos 3:14–15; 5:4–5; 7:9; 9:1; Hos 10:1–2, 8) and divine rejection of Israel’s ritual <page id="p111"/>festivals, sacrifices, and prayers (Amos 5:21–23; 8:11–12; Hos 2:13, 15; 6:1–6; 8:11–13; 9:4–5; 12:12). In Amos, however, the sacred sites of Bethel and Gilgal testify to the perfunctory worship of God by a people driven to enhance their wealth and social position (Amos 2:8; 4:4–5; 5:21–25; 8:4–6). In Hosea, the Israelite sanctuaries and “high places” are monuments to the worship of Baal and other deities whose illusory promises of agricultural fruitfulness have bedazzled the Israelites (Hos 2:7, 15; 4:9–14, 17–19; 8:4–6).</paft>
      <p>The common thread implicit in these two articulations becomes explicit in a few passages. Amos adds an accusation of devotion to idol-gods to the divine insistence on justice and righteousness (Amos 5:26–27; 8:14; cf. 2:4). Hosea links God’s dismantling of altars and sacred pillars to false oaths and divisive lawsuits that poison the community (Hos 10:2–4), and Ephraim is condemned as a merchant who amasses wealth through extortion and cheating (12:8–12). Both prophetic books warn against frequenting the sanctuaries of Gilgal and Bethel in similar language (Amos 5:5; Hos 4:15).</p>
      <bh id="bh0401">Leadership</bh>
      <paft>Amos and Hosea converge and diverge as well in their accusations of Israel’s leading figures. Amos turns prophetic fire on wealthy families within the Northern Kingdom who use their economic advantage to manipulate the weak and benefit from their misfortune. The royal house of Jeroboam is denounced as well as the priest Amaziah, who claims the sanctuary at Bethel as a royal possession and banishes the prophet from it (Amos 7:12–13). For the most part, however, the oracles of Amos accuse a dominant segment of the community, whose social and religious practices have distorted the ethos of the entire nation (Amos 2:6–8; 4:1–3; 5:10–13; 6:1–7; 8:4–10).</paft>
      <p><page id="p112"/>Hosea, too, portrays the degeneration of the whole community of Israel. The adulterous wife in Hosea 1—3 represents the Northern Kingdom of Israel. The introductory oracle in Hosea 4 assesses the injustice and violence of the entire community (Hos 4:1–3). The frequent accusations of “Ephraim” in Hosea are addressed to the people as a body. In Hosea, however, a heavy burden of blame falls on the nation’s spiritual leaders. The priests have failed to teach or model the knowledge of God (Hos 4:4–14; 6:8–10). As a result the Israelites have embraced idols, false symbols of hope and blessing (Hos 4:17–19; 8:4; 13:2), and made falsehood, theft, and violence the social norm (Hos 7:1–2). The nation’s kings reflect the state of the community at large, having ignored their responsibility to uphold justice in the land (Hos 7:3–7). Accusations of Israel’s royal leaders are often tied to denunciations of the people, who have supported violent seizures of royal power and trusted that kings and their armies can save the nation from harm rather than seeking God’s protection (Hos 8:4, 14; 13:9–11). Central to the people’s behavior in Hosea, however, is the laxity, corruption, and arrogance of their religious leaders, those designated to teach the knowledge of God.</p>
      <p>The Books of Amos and Hosea both raise hopes of an alternative to Israel’s current leaders. In Amos, God promises to rebuild the house of Davidic leadership (Amos 9:11). This declaration stands at the head of a series of divine promises of regeneration for Israel, implying the significant role of a Davidic figure in the return to abundance and safety. Similarly, in the narrative of Israel’s separation and eventual reconciliation with God in Hosea 3, the people’s return to seek “the Lord, their God” is linked with a search for “David, their king” (Hos 3:5; cf. 2:2). Although references to David do not play a major role in either Amos or Hosea, <page id="p113"/>David serves in both as the model of a divinely anointed king who will keep the people close to their God.</p>
      <bh id="bh0402">Actions, Consequences, and Divine Judgment</bh>
      <paft>Amos and Hosea also intersect and diverge in their portrayals of the way justice plays out. In both prophetic books catastrophe is a consequence of the social abuse and ritual offences that have eroded the nation’s connection with God. Both portray the coming judgment as a direct intervention by God to halt behavior that is destroying and endangering the community, with condemnation often proclaimed by God in the divine voice (in the first person).</paft>
      <p>At the same time, a pattern of actions leading directly to consequences is sometimes implied in Amos. Enemy powers stronger than Israel turn back on the Northern Kingdom the violence perpetrated within it (Amos 3:9–11). Divine withdrawal from a people who long for a word from God yet hear nothing (Amos 8:11–12) suggests that God will leave the Israelites to face the outcome of their own operating principles. The series of questions posed in Amos 3:3–8 affirm the natural, logical sequence of cause and effect. These questions conclude, however, with a matching divine dynamic: “Does disaster befall a city unless the Lord has caused it?,” implying that the divine hand is at work throughout the cosmic order (Amos 3:6).</p>
      <p>The portrayal of judgment as a natural unfolding of consequences is especially noticeable in Hosea. In 4:1–3, the land is seized by drought because of the harmful and destructive acts of its inhabitants. The people are trapped by their acts of devotion to foreign deities, enveloped by a “spirit of prostitution” and incapable of returning to a God they no longer know (Hos 5:3–4). They will come to grief “because of their iniquity,” unable to find help in the God <page id="p114"/>who has vanished from their sight (Hos 5:5–6; cf. 6:1–6; 8:2–3). The parable-like statement, “When they sow the wind, they will reap the whirlwind” traces the direct relationship between act and consequence (Hos 8:7). Thus the Northern Kingdom’s trust in its own strategies and armies will only bring “the clamor of war” upon it (Hos 10:13–14). That Israel’s chosen path is inherently self-destructive is clear in the comparison of Ephraim to a dove, “silly and senseless” (Hos 7:11) and to an “unwise child” (Hos 13:13), unprepared for the results of his or her behavior.</p>
      <p>Both Amos and Hosea trace an inescapable logic in the crisis looming over Israel, a logic that can be viewed from both natural and divine perspectives. In this the two prophetic books are reminiscent of the wisdom tradition articulated in the Book of Proverbs. The bulk of sayings and instructions in Proverbs sketch the observable consequences of human strengths and failings. Some sayings, however, remind audiences of God’s role in these outcomes, especially when contrasting the lives of the just and the wicked (cf. Prov 10). The speeches in Proverbs 1—9 encourage the young both to listen to parental advice and to trust in the Lord, reflecting on the divine origins of wisdom (cf. Prov 2:1–11; 3:1–20).</p>
      <p>The declaration in Amos that because the people of the Northern Kingdom “do not know how to do what is right” (Amos 3:10), they will themselves fall victim to violence and abuse is consistent with the pattern of wickedness leading to ruin in Proverbs. Consistent, too, is the reference to the wise as dumbstruck over the perpetration of injustices in Israel (Amos 5:13). The appeal in Amos to “seek good and not evil, that you may live; Then truly the Lord, the God of hosts, will be with you as you claim” (Amos 5:14) echoes the positive claims of Proverbs (cf. Prov 10:22, 27; 11:20; 12:2, 22). The prophetic challenge, “Can horses run over rock, or <page id="p115"/>can one plow the sea with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood” (Amos 6:12), is reminiscent of fable-like sayings in Proverbs (Prov 6:6–11; 30:15–33). At the same time, the role of divine agency is unambiguously stated in Amos: God is the One “who makes destruction fall suddenly upon the stronghold and brings ruin upon the fortress, the Lord is his name” (Amos 5:9).</p>
      <p>The oracles of Hosea evoke the wisdom tradition in their portrayal of a foolish people trapped by their own decisions and in need of divine correction (Hos 5:1–2; 7:12). The explicit statement that “a people without understanding comes to ruin” (Hos 4:14; cf. 4:10–11) resonates with the cultivation in Proverbs of understanding as a bulwark against human missteps (Prov 2:2, 5; 3:13; 4:1; 15:21). The pronouncement that “Israel has rejected what is good, the enemy shall pursue him” (Hos 8:3) follows the familiar proverbial connection between the rejection of the good and disaster. God’s instructions to Ephraim (Hos 10:12–13; 12:7; 14:2–4) parallel the parental instructions in Proverbs (Prov 3:1–12, 21–35; 4:10–19, 20–27). The wisdom saying with which the Book of Hosea concludes, however, underscores that the straight paths on which the just walk are the “paths of the Lord” (Hos 14:10) and, by implication, that remaining on them can bring what is good in Israel to fruition in the Lord’s presence (Hos 14:3, 6–8).</p>
      <ah id="ah0403">Amos and Hosea: Side by Side</ah>
      <paft>From one viewpoint the prophetic speeches of Hosea push beyond those of Amos, delving further into the depths of Israel’s failures as well as into their remedy. The oracles of Amos measure the separation between the Israelites and <page id="p116"/>their God in terms of violation of divine standards of justice and righteousness and a failure to recognize God as creator and guardian of cosmic order. Hosea attributes the abandonment of just behavior to the Israelites’ underlying failure to acknowledge and trust in God’s mercy and providence. The worship of the Baals and wooing of foreign powers are signs of the people’s inability to respond to divine mercy (<theb>ḥesed</theb>) with their own loyalty and commitment (Hos 14:2–4).</paft>
      <p>The extent to which the prophetic witness in Hosea develops that in Amos (and vice versa) and the extent to which each book represents a distinct prophetic perspective on the undoing of the Northern Kingdom is difficult to gauge. What can be appreciated is the way each reflects ongoing prophetic traditions and yet offers a singular formulation, with its own integrity, of those traditions.</p>
      <p>The Books of Amos and Hosea raise distinct yet not discordant voices that call attention to the interplay of divine justice and mercy and the manifold dimensions and dynamic of each. Each book foregrounds different facets of this interplay, and each enhances and enriches the other, in contrapuntal harmony.</p>

The condemnation of Israel’s sacrificial worship in Amos 5:21–25 allows the possibility that these sanctuaries were northern sanctuaries, such as Bethel and Gilgal, where Israel’s God was worshipped (see Amos 4:4–5; 5:4–5). The references to foreign gods in Amos 5:26 and 8:14 introduce the possibility of a link between indifference toward the vulnerable and the embrace of foreign rituals and idols. The same considerations apply to the temples mentioned in the following line (Amos 2:5).</fn>
